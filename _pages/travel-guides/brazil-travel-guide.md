## How my time in Brazil changed my life

With an overwhelming need to scratch my newly-acquired wanderlust itch, I set out on a six month solo backpacking trip in Brazil as soon as I finished high school. During my Rotary Youth Exchange year, I had come to know many people from all over the world, including a large number of Brazilians. While in Brazil, I stayed in the homes of my friends, many of which were Rotarians, and so I had many opportunities to present at Rotary Clubs and participate in community projects. The people I met, the strife I witnessed, the beauty of the people and the culture, all set me down the path of my lifeâ€™s work: to impact communities on the international stage.
