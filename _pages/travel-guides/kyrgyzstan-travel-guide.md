## The Switzerland of Central Asia

Dubbed The Switzerland of Central Asia, I lived in Kyrgyzstan for two years working with the United Nations on media and social justice development projects as a [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer. My time here was the most rewarding and meaningful time of my life. I spent my first year working with community radio station RadioMost in [Talas City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Talas,+Kyrgyzstan/@42.5299875,72.1879003,19243m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x38a15c82094a401b:0xef5a29b84864c140!6m1!1e1), where I helped create training materials for a growing national network of citizen journalists. Then, I wrote my own project concept and secured funding from UNESCO. There were many organizations supporting media training in these areas, but the reach of those journalists was very limited and very isolated. My concept was to leverage the power of mobile technology by placing it in the hands of rural journalists and building a unifying platform which tells the story of life in Central Asia. Today, [KyrgyzMedia.com](http://kyrgyzmedia.com/) is a vibrant and active outlet which receives thousands of montly visitors from all over the world and continues to be supported by the United Nations and the Deutsche Welle Akadamie. The initiative is locally supported by [Kloop Media](http://kloop.kg/).
