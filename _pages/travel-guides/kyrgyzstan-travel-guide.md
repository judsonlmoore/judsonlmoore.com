## The Switzerland of Central Asia

Dubbed The Switzerland of Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan is home to some of this planet's most beautiful and untouched nature. I lived in Kyrgyzstan for two years working with the United Nations on media and social justice development projects as a [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer. My time here was the most rewarding and meaningful time of my life, made even better by the Kirgiz hospitality and the opportunity to explore untouched nature. I go back to Kyrgyzstan every other year to catch up with [the media empire I founded](http://kyrgyzmedia.com/) and to reconnect with the people that make Central Asia feel like my second home.
