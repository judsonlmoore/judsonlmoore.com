## The opulence of the desert on a backpacker budget

On my flight back to [India](/india/) from [Colombia](/colombia/), I managed to work in a 36-hour layover in Abu Dhabi. I met up with one of my UNESCO contacts from my time in [Kyrgyzstan](/kyrgyzstan/) who now lives in Dubai. Together, we explored Abu Dhabi and Dubai, including a trip to Ski Dubai and a drive-by tour of the worldâ€™s most impressive modern architecture.
