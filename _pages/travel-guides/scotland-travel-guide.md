## Inspiring creativity since the Middle Ages

Scotland is a delightful country full of innovative people. For centuries, the Scots have brought the world a wide range of inventions, technological breakthroughs, and inspiration in the creative arts. For hundreds of years, King Author's tale has been shared and retold all around the world. In more recent times, Scotland provided much of the inspiration for the Harry Potter series. The Scots invented golf and whiskey, both of which can now be found in locales worldwide. In the sciences, Scotland is home to Dolly, the first cloned mammal.
