## Roadtripping through ancient civilizations

I was not prepared to be as impressed with Jordan as I was. Of course, I was excited to visit the country; otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered with the daunting boarder-crossings, and I am glad that I did. Jordan is one of the most interesting and beautiful places I have ever visited. Our three-day bus tour covered the country's most well-known sites, from Jerash's ancient northern city to Petra's far more ancient ruins near the Wadi Rum Desert. I didn't realize how high up my bucket list Jordan was until I was already there, and I encourage you to go there as soon as you're able.
