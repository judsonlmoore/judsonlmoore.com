## Roadtripping through ancient civilizations

I was not prepared to be as impressed with Jordan as I was. Of course, I was excited to visit the country; otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered with the daunting boarder-crossings, and I am so glad that I did. Jordan is one of the most interesting and beautiful places I have ever visited. Our three-day bus tour covered the country's most renowned sites, from the ancient northern city of Jerash to the far more ancient city of Petra near to the cinematic Wadi Rum Desert. I didn't realize how high up my bucket list Jordan was until I was already there, and I encourage you to go there as soon as you're able.
