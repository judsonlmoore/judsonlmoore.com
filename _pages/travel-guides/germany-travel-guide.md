## More than Wienerschnitzel and Bratwurst

As a Rotary Youth Exchange student, Germany was my first home outside of the United States. It was here that I began to develop a global view, make lifelong friends from other cultures, and started to drink coffee. My time in Germany is the most significant of any of my travels, because it was the first. Germany has always been dear to me, and after 16 years I have moved back to Germany! I am working now at trivago in DÃ¼sseldorf, which means there will be many more stories to fill this page!
