## More than wienerschnitzel and bratwurst

As a Rotary Youth Exchange student, Germany was my first home outside of the United States. It was here that I began to develop a global view, make lifelong friends from other cultures, and started to drink coffee. My time in Germany is the most significant of any of my travels because it was the first. Germany has always been dear to me, and after 16 years, I moved back to Germany to make it my home.
