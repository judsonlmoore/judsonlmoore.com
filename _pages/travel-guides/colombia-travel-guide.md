## Colombia is a gateway to the soul

Fifteen years after being a [Rotary Youth Exchange student](https://www.rotary.org/en/get-involved/exchange-ideas/youth-exchanges) in Germany, a group of us decided to reunite, but this time we would meet in Colombia. Our host, [Alejo](https://www.instagram.com/alejogb/), is a film producer and TV star in Colombia, so he knew all of the best places to go throughout the country and had the connections to get us there. For two weeks, we ate the freshest seafood and explored the most beautiful landscapes the country has to offer. We came close with nature, close with Colombian culture and even closer with each other.
