## Egypt is still the cradle of civilization 

[The Mohamed Shafik Gabr Foundation](http://www.msgabrfoundation.org/) is an Egyptian-based charitable organization with a history of good works, particularly in education and healthcare. The foundation supports a fellowship for young professionals in eastern and western countries to experience each otherâ€™s cultures and encourage a dialogue between emerging leaders in a wide variety of professional sectors. *[East-West: The Art of Dialogue](https://eastwestdialogue.org/)*, brings together ten easterners (predominantly Egyptians) and 10 Westerners (mainly Americans) and organizes five weeks of intense travel throughout Egypt and the United States. 

While on tour, fellows meet with leaders in economics, politics, education, religion, military, and the arts. Fellows also work together to write an action plan for a development project implemented in Egypt after the fellowship. For example, due to my participation in this fellowship, we founded [Cleopatra to Coretta](https://www.cleopatratocoretta.org/) to support globally-minded dialogue among female journalists.
