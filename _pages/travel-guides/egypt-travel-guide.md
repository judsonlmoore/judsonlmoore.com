## Egypt is still the cradle of civilization 

[The Mohamed Shafik Gabr Foundation](http://www.msgabrfoundation.org/) is an Egyptian-based charitable organization with a history of good works, particularly in the areas of education and healthcare. The foundation supports a fellowship for young professionals in eastern and western countries to come together to experience each other’s cultures and to encourage a dialogue between emerging leaders in a wide variety of professional sectors. *[East-West: The Art of Dialogue](https://eastwestdialogue.org/)*, brings together 10 easterners (predominantly Egyptians) and 10 Westerners (predominantly Americans) and organizes five weeks of intense travel throughout Egypt and the United States. While on tour, fellows meet with leaders in economics, politics, education, religion, military, and the arts. Fellows also work together to write an action plan for a development project which will be implemented in Egypt after the fellowship.
