## My preferred cruise destination 

Crisp, clean, air, and a forest hike might not be what first comes to mind when you think about taking a cruise, but this is exactly how I came to discover Norway. Though I was only in the country for a day, I captured some quick insights into how to get in and out of Norway in an affordable and alternative way, as well as a peek into the local culture and cuisine. I will visit again and encourage you to do the same.
