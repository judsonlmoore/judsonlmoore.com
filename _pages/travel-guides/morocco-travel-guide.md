## Diversity is everywhere

I have spent time in Central Asia and Southeast Asia, MENA, Europe, and North and South America. Until I visited Morocco, I had not understood the vast size and diversity one county could possess. This kingdom in northwest Africa is a former French colony and is a melting pot of European, African, and Arabic cultures and architecture. From the world’s oldest city center in Fez to the second highest peak in Africa in the High Atlas Mountains and the world’s largest desert in the Sahara, Morocco is as diverse as anywhere can be. The only thing that seems constant across the kingdom’s distant corners is the Moroccan people's kindness and hospitality.
