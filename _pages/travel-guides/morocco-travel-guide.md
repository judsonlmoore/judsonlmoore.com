## Morocco is the gateway between East and West

I have spent time in Central Asia, Egypt, Turkey, and of course, Europe and North America. Until I visited, I had never appreciated that Morocco was such a large country, or that it is such a diverse place. This kingdom in northwest Africa is a former French colony and is a melting pot of European, African, and Arabic cultures and architecture. From the world’s oldest city center in Fez, to the second highest peak in Africa in the High Atlas Mountains, and the world’s largest desert in the Sahara, Morocco is as diverse a place as anywhere can be. **The only thing that seems constant is the kindness and hospitality of the Moroccan people.**
