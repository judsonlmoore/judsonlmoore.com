## Switzerland is as delicious as it is beautiful 

Home of Charlie Chaplin, Nestl√©, the United Nations and many of my friends, Switzerland is not often a place I get to, but it is always a place I am excited to be. I first traveled here when I was 17 years old and did not see the snowcapped mountains again for over a decade as I made my way to the USA after a six-month business trip in India. In the German-speaking part of the country, I find myself feeling right at home with the Swiss. In the other parts of Switzerland, I enjoy the challenges of language barriers along with the majestic landscapes and delicious fondue.
