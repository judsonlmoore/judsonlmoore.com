## The story of my homeland

Born and raised in Kentucky, I moved to Louisiana as a teenager and started to find my place in the world. From the small central Louisiana city of Alexandria, I began to develop my passion for community engagement and my obsession with exploring new places. In America, I’ve lived in Baton Rouge, Las Vegas, Memphis, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Austin, among others. My best friend in high school has a sign in his backyard which says, “family is a close circle of friends who love you.” I’ve been blessed to find my family in many places as I’ve explored my own country, as well as others. I must admit, I write very little about my life in America, but whatever makes it’s way to this page is of deep importance to me.
