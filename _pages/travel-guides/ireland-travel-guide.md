## I learned that I am Irish!

Ireland is a gorgeous country with wonderful people and a rich heritage. From 2017-2019 I made multiple trips to the isle and explored some of the world's most untouched wilderness, toured haunted castles, and drank from the world's finest breweries and distilleries. The Irish people are lovely in every regard, and their hospitality rivals only that of my home in the American South. A trip to Ireland is a must-do in your lifetime.
