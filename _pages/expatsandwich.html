<h2>INDIA</h2>
<p>A 6-month business trip to India turned into half a year of adventuring around the country. I experienced nomadic life in Rajasthan. I contributed to building the technology sector of Hyderabad. I found forgotten European outposts from the days of the old tea trade. I even garnered inspiration from the Dalai Lama in the Himalayan foothills.</p>

<h2>BRAZIL</h2>
<p>I took a gap year (well.. half a year..) after high school to find myself and my place in the world. I backpacked across Brazil in this pursuit and visited friends I made the previous year as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student in Germany. The people I met, the strife I witnessed, the beauty of the people and the culture, all set me down&nbsp;the path of my life&rsquo;s work:&nbsp;<strong>to impact communities on the international&nbsp;stage.</strong></p>

<h2>KYRGYZSTAN</h2>
<p>I lived in Kyrgyzstan for two years working with the United Nations on media and social justice development projects as a&nbsp;Peace Corps&nbsp;volunteer. Now several years removed, I can see that&nbsp;<strong>the work I performed there has reached hundreds of thousands of people</strong>&nbsp;through the modern-day capacities of the internet and western-style journalism.</p>

<h2>GERMANY</h2>
<p>I have lived in Germany twice: first as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student when I was 17 years old, and again as an adult. In fact, I live in Germany now, where I am part of the team building the trivago hotel metasearch website. Living in Europe gives me access to some of the world&rsquo;s most interesting destinations, as well as a mission to serve the&nbsp;<strong>growing community of refugees coming in to Germany</strong>.</p>
