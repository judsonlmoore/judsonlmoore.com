			<h3>Hi! My name is Judson. It's nice to meet you!</h3>

			<p><em>“‘Judson?’ Interesting name. I have never heard that before!”</em> Oh but you probably do know of a Judson. Until PSY came along with Gangnam Style, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg" target="_blank">Judson Laipply’s Evolution of Dance</a> was the most viewed video on YouTube, with over 297 million views! It is true that there are not a lot of Judson’s out there. But those of us who do exist tend to get into some pretty neat stuff. Maybe it is part of growing up with a unique name that we feel we have to always stand out from the crowd!</p>

			<h3>My background</h3>

			<p>I was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky, in the USA. My mom is from Ohio and my dad is from Louisiana. Growing up in the middle meant splitting holidays between the two destinations visiting the two sides of the family. Because of this, I grew up experiencing a fairly diverse social landscape of America. This became more complicated over time as my brother’s health deteriorated until his death in 1998. Shortly thereafter, my dad got a great job opportunity in Louisiana, and though I was already in high school (typically a terrible time to move a kid), I jumped at this chance to live in and experience a new place.</p>

			<p>In Lexington, I had been an average kid. Sort of a <em>little fish in a big pond</em>. But in Alexandria, Louisiana, I sought to change my circumstances and become a big fish in that small pond. I became immediately involved with the community theater there, which was a whole new experience for em. I fell in love with community service and the arts. One fine summer when I was 16 years old, I was accepted into a youth leadership camp organized by the local Rotary Clubs, and it was there that the modern day story of Judson Moore truly began.</p>

			<h3>My invitation to you</h3>

			<p>If you want to learn more about how those early experiences shaped my life and have brought me to a place to inspire others, then I invite you to stick around and read some more of my blog. A good starting point is to read more about <a href="/showing-up-secret-to-success/">how that camp taught me the secret to all of my life’s successes</a> and the subsequent philosophies I have adopted regarding living ones’ “what if” and <a href="/why-travel-while-young/">the importance of starting that journey at a young age</a>.</p>

			<p>I would be honored for you to subscribe to my newsletter via the form below. You can learn more of my professional experiences over at my resume. And last but not least, if you also have an inspirational or interesting story to tell, then why not be a guest author on this blog? <a href="/guest-author/">Click here</a> to learn more about that.</p>
