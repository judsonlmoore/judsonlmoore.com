## My life philosophies in a nutshell

There are several principles, philosophies really, by which I have come to live my life. In the course of my book, [*Exponential Happiness*](/book/) I share each of these in great detail. I describe how I came to discover each of these principles, how they have challenged me, how I have challenged them, and how you can apply them to your way of thinking. Let me take a moment to outline a few of these:

- **The first philosophy:** find your *what if* and live it every day
- **The second philosophy:** show up
- **The third philosophy:** suffering does not make you stronger; learning does.
- **The fourth philosophy:** a bad plan is better than no plan
- **The fifth philosophy:** be flexible 
- **The sixth philosophy:** do it while you're young

By following these philosophies, the result is *exponential happiness*.

To learn more, read the posts below where I go in to greater detail about each of these philosophies. If they touch you, then I invite you to take a deeper dive with my book, [*Exponential Happiness*](/book/).
