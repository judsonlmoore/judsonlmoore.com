## My life philosophies

There are several principles, philosophies really, by which I have come to live my life. In the course of my book, [*Exponential Happiness*](/book/) I share each of these in great detail. I describe how I came to discover each of these principles, how they have challenged me, how I have challenged them, and how you can apply them to your way of thinking. Let me take a moment to outline a few of these:

**6 Phillosophies to live your life by**
- [Find your *what if* and live it every day](/the-first-philosophy-find-your-what-if/)
- [Show up](/the-second-philosophy-show-up/)
- [Suffering does not make you stronger; learning does.](/the-third-philosophy-suffering-does-not-make-you-stronger/)
- [A bad plan is better than no plan](/the-fourth-philosophy-a-bad-plan-is-better-than-no-plan/)
- [Be flexible](/the-fifth-philosophy-be-flexible/)
- [Do it while you're young](/the-sixth-philosophy-do-it-while-youre-young/)

By following these philosophies, the result in your life is ***exponential happiness***.

To learn more, read the posts below where I go in to greater detail about each of these philosophies. If they touch you, then I invite you to take a deeper dive with my book, [*Exponential Happiness*](/book/).
