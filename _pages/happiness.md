## My life philosophies 

There are several principles, philosophies really, by which I have come to live my life. In the course of my book, *[Exponential Happiness](/book)* I share each of these in great detail. I describe how I came to discover each of these principles, how they have challenged me, how I have challenged them, and how you can apply them to your way of thinking. Let me take a moment to outline a few of these:

### 6 Philosophies to live your life by

Here are the six philosophies by which I strive to live my life every day. 

- [Find your *what if* and live it every day](/the-first-philosophy-find-your-what-if/)
- [Show up](/the-second-philosophy-show-up/)
- [Suffering does not make you stronger; learning does.](/the-third-philosophy-suffering-does-not-make-you-stronger/)
- [A bad plan is better than no plan](/the-fourth-philosophy-a-bad-plan-is-better-than-no-plan)
- [Be flexible](/the-fifth-philosophy-be-flexible/)
- [Do it while you're young](/the-sixth-philosophy-do-it-while-youre-young/)

By following these philosophies, the result in your life is ***exponential happiness***.
