## Female travel advice written for and by women

I am a flawed man in many ways. I can only hope to share advice which is valuable to my readers. Half of my readers are women. Despite my many flaws, I like to think that I am smart enough to identify my shortcomings. I feel that it is very important to discuss issues which are specific to female travel and I hope that this blog can contribute to many successful and happy womensâ€™ adventures. But I also know that my perspective and experience in travel is all gained through the male perspective. Therefor, I have sought out some experienced women travelers to share their experiences here as guest authors.
