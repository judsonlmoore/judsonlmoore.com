## Applied decision-making

Product management plays a central role in the software development workflow. On one side sits the stakeholders, business developers, user researchers, and analytics teams, each inputting a seemingly endless amount of requirements and opportunities. On the other side lies the engineering and delivery team with constraints regarding what can be delivered over a specific period. 

The product manager sits in the middle of this field and has the responsibility of absorbing all of the inputs and contemplating them against the reality of delivery constraints. Balancing those elements, the product manager's task is to decide what scope of work will get done and with what priority.

In this section of the blog, I share learnings from my profession as a product manager at trivago, eBay, and as a product lead of other open-source and community software projects.
