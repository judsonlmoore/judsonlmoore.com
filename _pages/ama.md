## Egypt is still the cradle of civilization 

[The Mohamed Shafik Gabr Foundation](http://www.msgabrfoundation.org/) is an Egyptian-based charitable organization with a history of good works, particularly in the areas of education and healthcare access. A few years ago, the foundation decided to support a fellowship for young professionals in Egypt and western countries to come together to experience each otherâ€™s cultures and to encourage a dialogue between emerging leaders in a wide variety of professional sectors. *[East-West: The Art of Dialogue](https://eastwestdialogue.org/)*, brings together 10 Egyptians, 10 Westerners (predominantly Americans) and organizes five weeks of intense travel throughout Egypt and the United States. While on tour, fellows meet with leaders in economics, politics and the arts. Fellows also work together to write an action plan for a development project which will be implemented in Egypt.
