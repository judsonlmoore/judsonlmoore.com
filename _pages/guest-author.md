I hope to encourage a conversation between us, rather than just a one-way sort of thing where you write content and post it. What I have written below are some initial thoughts on topics and formats for posts which you can author. Please feel free to suggest a completely different direction or provide me with feedback if you think my approach can be improved.

I write a lot about taking action on personal goals starting at a young age. You can write about any number of topics but still relate it to the over-arching theme of the blog, which is about pursuing happiness while young.

## About the blog

JudsonLMoore.com is the personal blog of Judson L Moore. It started in the year 2000 as a way to share travel experiences with Judson's close friends and family. Over the years, it has seen many iterations from a professional portfolio to an advice column. Currently, the blog is a combination of several things.

- **#WhileYoung** – these are posts that offer advice, best practices, and insights learned from the author's life experiences. Guest authors write some of these posts.
- **Travel Guides** – these are posts from Judson's travels across the world and what he has done there. In the beginning, these were written strictly in an autobiographical format but are now being rewritten and curated into travel guides, which offer more of an overview of destinations, alongside recommendations of activities to pursue or to avoid.

## Women guest authors

Women writers, in particular, are encouraged to get in touch with me. I am very interested in supporting women authors and highlighting their perspective on travel and the pursuit of happiness. A woman's perspective on travel and career is clearly a super important topic to cover, and as a man, I have zero authority on the subject (and just so happen to be smart enough to know it!)

## Why be a guest author?

A primary reason you might consider being a Guest Author on any site is exposure to a new audience. Publishing your original content on a space other than your own gives you access to a fresh audience. Including links to your blog, social media, and other content is a great way to drive traffic back to your blog and spread your presence on the internet.

Additionally, when a guest author publishes content here, those posts are shared to this blog's audience via:

- Newsletter
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram (as appropriate)

## Why do I want guest authors?

In the same way that this site can offer a guest author access to a new audience and drive traffic back to their site(s), it is expected that guest authors will promote their content via their marketing channels to drive traffic to their posts on this site. By having other voices contribute to the overarching theme of this blog, a higher degree of creditability is developed for this blog's content.

## Guest post guidelines

For an article to be accepted, it must meet the following guidelines:

- **Relevancy to Niche:** content MUST tie in to travel, career, or life advice about living your dreams and succeeding in your goals. This can cover a wide range of topics, so if you are unsure where to start, please reach out to me, and we can discuss it.
- ​**Linking Policy:** I encourage you to include links in the copy of your post. Here are the types of links you should include, and the limits of how many links will be accepted. This can be flexible, depending on the kind of post. For example, a list post with a long list of resources should have many more links than this, but this is a good starting point to aim for:
  - **2 links** to your own blog or content
  - **2 links** to other content on this blog
  - **1 link** to 3rd party​ source
- **Editing:** I do not censor your words or wish to influence your thoughts. However, I reserve the right to do some light editing of any submission, mostly for SEO optimization purposes. Any changes I make to your writing will be sent back to you for approval before I publish it.

## How to be considered

Anyone with a story to tell and a perspective to share is welcomed to submit a post for consideration.

I recommend first reaching out with your proposed title or topic. Once I give the green light, then proceed with your article. You can send me your ideas at [guestauthor@judsonlmoore.com](mailto:guestauthor@judsonlmoore.com).

I will respond to your email or submission within 72 hours. I look forward to speaking with you soon!
