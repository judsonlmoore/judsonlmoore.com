## Why do it while you're young?

I've lived on five continents, traveled to 30+ countries, and have collected many stories of my travel. But what should that mean to you? Here is a collection of posts where I share advice, best practices, and encouragement for how you can live a similarly adventurous life as I have. Though it is never too late to get started, I have learned that beginning **while young** is a great benefit. Thus, I encourage you to *do it while you're young.*
