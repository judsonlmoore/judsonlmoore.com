## Why do it while you're young?

I’ve lived on five continents, traveled to 30+ countries and have collected many stories of my personal travel. But what should that mean to you? Here is a collection of posts where I share advice, best practices and encouragement for how you can live a similarly adventerous life as I have. Though it is never too late to get started, I have learned that starting **while young** is a great benefit, thus, I encourage you to *do it while you’re young.*
