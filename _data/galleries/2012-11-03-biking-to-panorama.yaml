Looking out over Panorama toward Bishkek and the fresh smog hovering over the city.

Arriving to the peak of the hill was too hard by bike. I had to walk it a little bit.

Daniel wiped out in front of me. I almost ran over his head but luckily I missed.

Daniel got a little scraped up but he was fine.
