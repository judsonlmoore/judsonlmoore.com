Just before I published my first book, [Exponential Happiness](/book/), my publisher, LeanPub, honored me with a feature on their podcast for authors. We had quite a long chat, but it is pretty interesting, if I may say so myself. 

Len Epp is Leanpub's co-founder. During his interview of me, we discussed: 

- My background
- The Rotary summer camp that changed my life
- The 1-year I studied abroad in Germany and how that impacted the rest of my life
- My parents' activism during my youth regarding the rights of people with disabilities and their families
- My years working for the Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan and helping to set up a network of journalists
- My time working in Hyderabad, India
- My eventual return to Germany
- My book (of course!)
- My experience as a self-published author

The full transcript and shownotes can be found on [the LeanPub Frontmatter Podcast website](https://leanpub.com/podcasts/frontmatter/judson-l-moore-12-07-19).
