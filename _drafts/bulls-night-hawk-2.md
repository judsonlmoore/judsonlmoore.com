The 2015 Bulls Night Hawk 2 is a beautiful bike that has a very clean design thanks to its crank-mounted rear brake.

The bike has a carbon fiber monocoque as frame, a Shimano Ultegra gearbox with 2x11 gears and a Mavic Aksiun One wheelset with Schwalbe One tires.

In terms of parts, the Shimano Ultegra is what makes the clock; Ultegra brakes, Ultegra crankset, Ultegra shifters, Ultegra derailleurs and an Ultegra cassette. So that can't go wrong!

Further parts come from FSA and Fizik, seasoned brands that have been suppliers to Bulls for years.
