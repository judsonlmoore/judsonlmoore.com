    "title": "Tips for how to successfully find work abroad as an American",
    "body": "2018/11/06 - The whole reason I started this blog was as a way to publicly answer the question I have been asked for many years, “Judson, how do you get to travel so much?” The answer to that is varied and complex if you want it to be. On one side, it is as simple as saying that I just packed my bag and went for it, but of course, there is a large degree of planning that goes into making the plans which lead to a successful experience abroad. I don’t regret any of my moves abroad, but not all of them have worked out as hoped. For many years, Europe seemed to be a black box as an American trying to work there. I tried many things and even made a failed attempt to move to England in 2009. Moving abroad as a student is relatively easy. Perhaps even getting an internship or very entry-level job under the right conditions could be managed without too much difficulty. But what about those of us who have long-sense graduated and are not willing to take a massive pay cut as an intern? It is said that beggars can’t be choosers, and I will confess that some sacrifice might be necessary, but with a good strategy and a lot of motivation, I believe that anyone can find a way to make a successful move abroad and land a satisfying and rewarding job in the process. Recommended reading: The Secret to all my Success I am thrilled to now say that I have lived and worked for more than two years in Germany and have been having a great time while I am at it. A lot of people have started to now ask “Judson, what tips do you have for now to find work in Germany as an immigrant?” So I thought it was about time that I write down my observations and thoughts about how you too can make a successful move to Europe. Moreover, I think that this advice is relevant regardless of where you are from and to what country you would like to move to. While reading this, keep in mind that there are many avenues which can lead to a successful move abroad. Maybe you have a heritage claim, are very skilled in your discipline, you’re married to a person from that country, so on and so forth. The following insights are limited to my recent observations but I think you will see the logic behind my claims. If you spot a flaw in my thinking or would like to offer additional ideas, please leave a comment below. Disclaimer: The opportunity that brought me to Germany was in-part thanks to a friend giving me an inside recommendation at trivago. That friend was a classmate back in my 2000-01 Rotary Youth Exchange year in Oldenburg, Germany, and so yes, my successful move to Germany is yet another “who you know” situation. That said, what I offer below is more generic tips and insights which I believe will be useful to anyone looking for a job abroad. Another disclaimer: As I mention my employer several times in this post, I would like to point out that my statements do not necessarily reflect the views of trivago, nor are they necessarily endorsed by trivago. Your greatest asset: Native Language and Market Knowledge: There are smart and talented people with relevant job experience all over the world. So why would a company hire you and take on the headache of immigration visa sponsorship when they could just hire someone down the street? After all, the root of many immigration laws is designed to protect citizens’ ability to work and to have preference over anyone else. A company with a job opening has to prove first that no available applicant in the country can do the job to which you are applying, and therefore they are considering a foreign applicant. Keeping that in mind, there are three reasons why a company might be allowed to hire an immigrant:  You work in a field which is in high demand and there is a shortage of qualified local applicants (many STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) jobs are in this category);2) You are truly an expert in your field and bring a level of thought leadership in the industry to the company which can not be found in the country (maybe you wrote a book or gave a TED Talk with millions of views on the topic of the role to which you are applying);  You have native-level fluency in your native language and, as a native of your country, you understand the culture, business, and people to a degree which a non-native person simply can not. You may very well qualify under point 1 or 2 of this list, but that will apply to a smaller number of people. If 1 and 2 apply to you, then you probably also don’t need to be reading this article (not that it hurts!) because you already have a fast and direct path into your dream job abroad. Point 3 was how I made my current move to Germany, thusly, I argue that your greatest asset is native language and market knowledge. What companies desire your skills?: This is the key part. Actually, this insight, which I only recently became conscious of, is probably the single most important part of finding a job abroad, and it is very simple. You should be looking for companies which meet these two criteria:    Are based in the country where you want to move; and     Do business in the country where you are native.  It’s that simple! But let me explain the logic here. Let’s say you are American and you want to work in Germany (trying to be consistent with my examples here…). American companies with offices in Germany (think: Facebook, Google, Amazon, IBM, Nike, Ford) built those offices because they needed local market knowledge in Germany. They already have plenty of American-based resources. So working for one of these companies in Germany might be quite difficult. Now consider the large German-based companies which do business in America (think: trivago, Bayer, BMW, Adidas, Puma) they are headquartered in Germany and they seek experts in the markets where they operate. Sure, many of those companies will have offices around the world to service this need, but HQ also needs some people to be present and to offer insight about the various markets around the world in which they operate. This is where you come in. Look for these companies, check out their open roles, and see what might be a good fit. Pro Tip: do a job search on LinkedIn for the keyword “English” and then add filters for “location = Germany” and “job type = full-time. ” The results will be available jobs that require English in Germany! Note that some of them will say, “requires excellent English and German,” but a lot will just mention English. This is your target list of companies. What kind of roles should you go for?: You may or may not find that the career path you are currently on or would like to be on, falls inside of the permitters of what you are likely to get a visa for. Just the same, there are ways to leverage your experience, whatever it is, to land you a first job abroad.  Since we are talking about companies with international reach, they are going to have a number of departments which require the market knowledge and language skills which only a native can deliver on. Here are a few examples:    Sales     Marketing     Media Buying     Content Marketing     Business Development     UX and other Copywriting     SOX Compliance (for publicly traded companies)     Legal and paralegal work, including proofreading of legal documents  If none of that sounds like a longterm passion for you, ask yourself, “would an international experience in one of these fields serve me well later in my career for what I really want to do?” If so, then why not give it a try? Not only might you find your way into that coveted visa, but you also will gain valuable experience while getting your foot in the door. This is just the beginning. Recommended Reading: High-tech Tips for any Resume But I don’t want to be in Sales or Marketing!: Me either! But the fact is, getting a visa is really hard. Once you have a visa, are in the country, are at the company, then life gets a lot easier. In a lot of circumstances, you can change roles internally at the company (which is what I did at trivago). My first job was as a North American spokesperson for trivago’s B2B products. I had native English and despite having no industry knowledge, I had market expertise because I know how to speak with and present to Americans. After one year, I shifted into the role I really wanted, software product management, a role which I would have never gotten a visa for, but NOW (and only now) there was an additional argument to say to the visa authorities which was, “Judson understands the American user, hotelier, and has an intimate knowledge of how our business operates, thus making him an ideal product manager which we could not find in another applicant. ” See how that worked? It is the ole’ bait and switch! But seriously, it was a good strategy for my long-term goals and yes, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun in that one year as a spokesperson. Some additional suggestions: Who you know can still play a big role here. Reach out to your network and figure out who works for a company based abroad, knows someone who does, or who might get you an introduction. Set up informational interviews just to ask the question, “if I were to apply to a role in your country or at your company, what skills, experience, and knowledge, would you find most attractive? Google phrases similar to “English speaking jobs in __” and “English speaking companies in __” to find articles which cover this topic. Join networks such as InterNations, CouchSurfing, LinkedIn Premium, XING (German LinkedIn), Rotary, and anything else with a focus on international networking. If moving to Germany is your goal then sites like HowToGermany. com and LifeInDuesseldorf. com are really great resources. I am pretty sure every country and major city has similar sites. Facebook Groups exist for every topic you can imagine. Look around for ones with titles like “Expats in Germany,” or “Expats in Duesseldorf,” and even “English speakers of _. ” How did it go?: Go give this a try, look around LinkedIn, and let me know what you discover and how it went by leaving a comment below. Do you have other advice to offer? Please share that here as well, and good luck, you can do it! 1"

    "title": "The Lost City of Petra is More Amazing Than I Ever Imagined",
    "body": "2018/10/28 - The lost city of Petra, of Indiana Jones fame, sits in the southern territories of Jordan, between Amman and Wadi Rum. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has been on my bucket list for a long time and I am glad to report that it does not disappoint. All I really knew about Petra was The Treasury building, which is famous for being the resting place of the Holy Grail in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I was thrilled to descend the long and winding Siq, or path, into Petra, where The Treasury is not the first thing you see along the path, and as it turns out, it is not nearly the last thing either. Petra In a Nutshell:  Highlights - Unbelievable mysteries to explore, open-range hiking and exploration, more sites than you could find in a week of trying, high-speed and open WiFi almost everywhere, clean and modern bathrooms.  Lowlights - Not very accessible if you have limited mobility.  Bottom Line - No trip to Israel or Jordan is complete without a day in Petra. Hands down, this is a top-5 site in the world. How to get to Petra: I joined a tour group out of Tel-Aviv to make this journey into Jordan. Along with visiting Wadi Rum and Jerash, we also got a day in Petra. The tour was operated by Abraham Tours and cost about $500USD inclusive of transportation, food, and accommodation. Pro tip: if you book a night at the Abraham hostel, you get 10% off any tour they offer. In this case, a $20 room saved me $50. Nice! The drive to Petra is its own experience. The roads are very new and well-maintained, so no fear there! Along the way, you get treated to incredible views of the desert vistas and a sneak-peak into the lifestyles of modern-day Bedouin tribes. Upon arrival at the entrance to Petra, there are a few hotels and ample parking, so if you were to come here on your own, there are some really nice places to stay. The welcome center to Petra is much more than a gift shop and a ticket booth. There are a series of cafes and restaurants, a museum, an official hotel, and also a bar claiming to be the world’s oldest because it is inside of a cave which has been actively used for trade and rest for thousands of years. Just the same, it is a really awesome place to relax at the end of the day. But let’s leave that for later. Time to descend the Siq and discover Petra! A 1-day ticket to Petra. The Siq into Petra: The sloping path into Petra is called the Siq. It is a gently-sloping dirt and stone path on the main Petra trail which is 8km long. Along the way, there are various tombs and petroglyphs to admire before the path is taken over by towering walls formed by a massive earthquake eons ago. The majority of structures which you will discover in Petra are tombs and are the only remaining symbols of the Nabataean Kingdom which ruled the area from 400BC until the Roman’s conquered them in the 1st Century AD. Not much is known about the Nabataean people except for what has been found in trade Greek and Roman trade records from the era. Obelisk Tomb and the Triclinium along the Siq to Petra The tombs of Petra do not have names or years indicated on them, however, some of the architecture in Petra offers clues about the period in which they were built. One of the first structures you come to along the Siq is called the Obelisk Tomb. It is called this because it features obelisks, which is very uncommon in Petra. Probably this tomb was built for a wealthy Egyptian merchant or someone who had a strong connection with Egypt. One thing to note about these structures is that they are not built. Rather, they are carved. What you see here in all these photos are structures carved into the side of mountains. Occasionally, where the curvature of the rock-face wasn’t large enough to accommodate the builder’s vision, some stone might be added on top, but for the most part, these structures have all been carved out of the side of the mountains with great precision and little error. Impressive! Beyond the Obelisk Tomb and a few others, the rock walls start to climb up on either side and the Petra experience turns into something truly unique. The predominant material in Petra is sandstone. The sandstone is iron-rich, giving it a brilliant rose color (similarly to why the sand in Wadi Rum is red). Millenia of water flow has carved the walls and floor of the Siq smooth, adding to the alien-like environment. Pro tip: check the weather for any rain before you go. Petra is known to flash-flood and it is very dangerous to be in the Siq when it is raining anywhere in the region. The local police and guides take every precaution to give advance warnings and to evacuate visitors. I arrived on a dry day, but our guide showed a video from 1-week before when the whole place was full of rapids! One really interesting thing to note in the Siq (as pictured below) is the waist-high channels carved into the sides of the walls. These are actually aqueducts which carried fresh water to the buildings below! In a few places you can still see the clay pipes which were set into these carvings, but in most places, it is just an open trough today. Halfway down the Siq on the way to The Treasury at Petra The Treasury at Petra: As you approach the bottom of the Siq, a view of The Treasury starts to thinly reveal itself before suddenly the whole thing comes in to view and you find yourself in a deep cavern surrounded by magnificent walls on all sides and The Treasury looming over you. It is a site to behold and it is no wonder that The Treasury was voted as one of the New7Wonders of the World in 2007! Of course, this is the building that India Jones made famous as being the resting place of the Holy Grail. Great movie, and a perfect location for that scene, but certainly not what this building ever did. Inside, rather than a labyrinth of obstacles which can only be passed by the devout and the hyper-intelligent (Indi. . ), there is a single large chamber with no markings, carvings, or anything else which would suggest much of anything. Due to years of vandalization and graffiti, the inside of The Treasury is not accessible to visitors, but that’s ok, the outside is where the show is. Of all the structures in Petra, The Treasury is the most well-preserved due to the closeness of the surrounding cliffs. The Treasury only receives a maximum of 4-hours of daylight per day and is protected from wind, rain, and other elements which could cause it harm. Pro tip: The photo below is taken upon a ledge high above the place where the Siq ends in front of the Treasury. There are two ways to get there: the 3. 5km (2. 2 miles) Al-Khubtha trail (AKA green trail), which takes about 3 hours or pay one of the local kids at The Treasury to take you up a secret (and guarded) path which takes about 5 minutes. Trust me, you don’t want to do this by yourself and the $5 will help a local family. The best part: you get an awesome photo like this, and now you freed up 3 hours of your day to explore other trails instead! The Treasury at Petra. Getting around inside Petra: Thanks to eons of water flow and millions of visitors, the paths around Petra are pretty smooth and free of obstacles, so I argue that the best method of transportation is your own two feet. Keeping that in mind, Petra is 264 sq km (102 sq miles) and the whole site is on a slope, not to mention that each of the impressive sites resides atop of a different hill. So if by the end of the day you find yourself a bit exhausted, I wouldn’t judge you for hopping on a camel or donkey back to the visitor’s entrance. Additional Reading: Mars on Earth: The Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan There are several camel stations around Petra, so you can hop on one from and to just about anywhere. If you were to take one at all, I recommend that you wait until the end of the day and take one from next to the Treasury back up to the visitor’s entrance. Camels and donkeys await tourists to give rides to. The Monastery at Petra: What I most enjoyed about Petra is that it is so much more than The Treasury. I had no idea that Petra was a whole ancient city and not just that one building. There are many tombs and other buildings carved into the sandstone at Petra, The Treasury is just the most well-preserved. The Monastery is the biggest monument and was built around 100BC. This magnificent structure appears to be built rather than carved, but actually, it is a mix. You can see the rock wall to the right is part of the original hillside from which The Monastery is indeed carved. But you can also see a sloping seam-line on the column left of center which slopes in the direction of the original hillside, thus indicating that the top of the Monastery was indeed built, at least in part. The Monastery at Petra The High Place of Sacrifice and Trail: The name “Petra” comes from the Greek word “petros” which means “stone, rock. ” Greek merchants observed the city’s inhabitants offering sacrifice to their deity on a large stone, and thus the city became known as Petra. Considering this, a stroll to the High Place of Sacrifice is highly recommended. The trail has two entrance points: one next to the Amphitheater behind The Treasury, and one closer to the trailhead which goes up to the Monastery. I recommend seeing the Monastery first and then take the trail to the High Place of Sacrifice because then you’ll be pointed in the right direction to head out to the visitor’s entrance. Many people only do the short in/out part of the trail from the Amphitheater, but that is a mistake! The longer part of the trail is much easier going up and there are incredible sites along the way. Aside from the trail being very beautiful and mostly void of other visitors, there are a number of other tombs along the way which you can enter and fully explore. When you do arrive at the High Place of Sacrifice, you will be confronted with the best panoramic view of Petra, which you can enjoy over a cup of Bedouin tea, prepared fresh for you in a small tent with comfortable seating right on the edge of the cliff. [gallery link=”file” size=”medium” ids=”19053,19061,19064”] The Royal Tombs of Petra, taken from atop the High Place of Sacrifice When are you going to Petra?: Tag! You’re it!

    "title": "Mars on Earth - The Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan",
    "body": "2018/08/27 - Wadi Rum’s Hollywood Fame and Tourism: Wadi Rum is an iron-rich desert in the south of Jordan which is famous for its Mars-like landscapes. The iron and mineral content of the sand here gives the desert a red coloring which is unlike anything you can see elsewhere on the planet. Because of this, Wadi Rum has become a popular destination for Hollywood to film. Films such as Lawrence of Arabia, which kickstarted the tourism industry in this area of Jordan, and more recently, The Martian, have brought fame and tourism to the desert for decades. Getting to Wadi Rum is actually a lot easier than you might suspect. If you are already in the area, visiting other parts of Jordan, or Israel, don’t miss the opportunity to visit this fascinating place. Wadi Rum In a Nutshell:  Highlights - Breathtaking views unlike anything else you can see. Even though it is a desert, there are some historical markers and interesting stories to walk in the footsteps of. Great hospitality from the locals.  Lowlights - Without a jeep, camel, or guide, I couldn’t imagine spending more than a day here.  Bottomline - Though some consider Wadi Rum to be the best Middle Eastern destination for hikers, climbers, campers, and nature lovers, I wouldn’t recommend spending more than 24-hours in Wadi Rum. But don’t dare come within 100km and not come here for at least half a day. It is amazing!Human History in the Desert: Tens of thousands of petroglyphs and inscriptions have been found on the rocks of Wadi Rum, which date roughly 12,000 years of human presence in the area. The Bedouin people and culture have the longest steady claim in the area, but the origins of human civilization and migration are rooted in Wadi Rum and the surrounding areas. Even the nearby site of the City of Petra, which was the capital of the mysterious Nabataeans, only dates back a fraction as long as that of early humans. But enough with the human history: what can people do here today? Well, people still live here and carry on a desert and nomadic culture. Though trade was once the core of the local economy, like that of the Silk Road, Wadi Rum now flourishes on tourism. My new friends from the Wadi Rum tour, including Tiffany Tchouboukjian (opposite from me), pilled up in the back of a truck for our desert jeep tour Tours of Wadi Rum: I booked a multi-day group tour from Abraham Tours in Israel, so I didn’t have to organize anything on my own. To be honest, you could come here on your own that that would be just fine, but I found the service of a tour company and guide to be well worth the relatively low cost just so that I wouldn’t have to worry about the border crossings or transportation and lodging logistics.  Abraham Tours did a great job and I recommend them to you, but you can also do a Google search to see if you find something better.  Pro Tip: Abraham Tours is owned by Abraham Hostels, which has locations in Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem. If you book a room at the hostel, you get a 10% discount on any tour. In this case, a $20 room saved me $50 on the tour. So it was like getting $30 cash-back and a free room for a night! The tour included stops in Jerash, Amman, Petra, and lastly (but most certainly not lastly), Wadi Rum. The tour group included 30 people from all walks of life, but everyone was pretty much awesome. By the time we arrived at Wadi Rum, we were all buddies for sure. The Wadi Rum tour consisted of three parts: jeep tour, camel tour (optional), lunch.  Jeep is the best way to get around the desert, I believe. We only ever got stuck in the sand once! The jeeps line up at the Lawrence Memorial Bedouin Camp. Camels of Wadi Rum: For those of you who have read my articles for some time now, you might have noticed I sometimes obsess on camels a bit. I don’t know where this comes from. I think they just photograph nicely and are somehow exotic animals in exotic landscapes. But just the same, when I see a camel, I jump at the opportunity to learn about them. In Wadi Rum, you will see two types of camels when you visit: those which are saddled and prepped for safari and those which are just walking free. However, none of these camels are wild. They are all domesticated and all belong to someone. Camels are left to free-range grazing and wandering off to their favorite watering hole because they pretty much always return home to their owner. They are quite loyal like that. Camels do go missing from time to time, but according to the guides I spoke with, they didn’t seem too worried about it because the camels always turn up somewhere soon enough. It is sort of like what we say in the USA, “it all comes out in the laundry,” meaning that whatever balance needs to be found, it will be eventually. So no stress! And here is something new I learned: when you see camels freely walking in a straight line, it means they intend to walk a really long distance! I wonder if that has to do with aerodynamics? Camels of the Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan Desert Camel Safari: Despite my weird love for camels, when offered the optional opportunity to take a camel safari in Wadi Rum: I declined. It was going to be an extra $20 and I already had enough desert camel safari when I was in Pushkar, India. But if you have never ridden a camel: do it here! The camels were more well-behaved than the ones in India, and though both the Rajasthan and Wadi Rum deserts are majestic, this one is pretty unique. This camel safari only lasted 20-30 minutes and ended at the Lawrence Memorial Bedouin Camp where I was already waiting for everyone, as I came in a jeep. This also meant I had more time for drinking the incredible (and incredibly sweet) Bedouin tea! The camel safari of the Wadi Rum Desert Petroglyphs and Inscriptions: Right, so I mentioned the 12,000-year-old origins of humans in the area. Wadi Rum is scattered with more than 40,000 known petroglyphs and inscriptions on the rocks. The point of our tour where the camel safari began is one such point of interest where these markings are clearly visible. Luckily, the markings are very much out of reach without a ladder, which is probably one of the reasons they have lasted for so long.  Petroglyphs and inscriptions in Wadi Rum date as far back as 10,000 B. C. No Filter Needed: I am occasionally guilty of applying some filter or editing touches to photos. But I wanted to highlight that the next landscape photo is totally untouched. This is just how the place looks. And this was taken with an iPhone, not a professional camera, which means the color depth of the photo is not nearly as rich as the real-life view of Wadi Rum. This place is just truly spectacular, and at every turn, you better be prepared to lose your breath! The Seven Pillars of Wisdom rock formation in Wadi Rum, Jordan I hope you enjoyed this article!

    "title": "DRUMSON performs live at the trivagoVibe",
    "body": "2018/08/21 - I love working at trivago! The company embodies many of my core passions: technology and innovation, travel, multiculturalism, and on occasion, music! The trivagoVibe is a bi-annual concert of trivago’s musically-talented employees and is the activity where I have the most fun at work (and yes, that includes the famed trivago on Tour annual trip. Nothing beats live music in my book!) And at trivago, live music means trivagoVibe! trivago recently moved into a new spaceship-like campus in Düsseldorf, which is an incredible facility in every way, including lots of open-air spaces which are perfect for music. During the past trivagoVibes, I didn’t have the opportunity to perform and so this time I was as proactive as possible to make sure that I would be included in the lineup. I couldn’t be more satisfied with the outcomes. The lineup of musicians was incredibly impressive. With a range of genres from singer-songwriter, blues, country, rock, and dance music, there was something for everyone.  		    		    		    		    	  		         		         		         		         	      Previous      Next How e-Drums Changed Everything: A few years back while I was traveling across India, I had an identity crisis. I came to understand that if I wanted to continue saying, “I am a drummer,” instead of, “I was a drummer,” then I better start drumming more regularly. My nomadic and apartment-dwelling lifestyle was not conducive to such loud and bulky habits. One night, while laying in bed, I was watching drumming YouTube videos when I came across a Drumeo video featuring Michael Schack, Roland’s endorsed artist for their flagship e-drums. I was hooked, and 10-minutes later, I was typing my credit card into eBay where I found a great deal on a Roland TD-30KV drum set. In the past years, I have enjoyed coming home to my 1-bedroom apartment and jamming under the headphones late into the night without disturbing my neighbors. I even did a few studio recordings with the drums (they sound even better than ‘real’ drums on recordings) but never dared to dream of using them for a live performance; I am too much of an acoustic-purist to play e-drums live! But here I am in Germany, no gigs played in the two years since I moved here, no bands to play with, and yet there is an opportunity at work where I could perform. But perform with who?? Sure, I talked to some other musicians, but I think they shared my view on acoustic drums being the only proper drums for a band. And so I was left without buddies to jam with. One day I decided, “Judson, you can do this alone. After all, Michael Schack can do it, so why can’t you?” And so that is what I set out to do: a one-man band drumming extravaganza. Now things are about to get interesting! Soundcheck is for Sharing: On the week of the show, I show up to my spaceship-esque office with my spaceship-esque drums, and not even I really know what to make of it. I have never hooked this Roland kit up to external speakers before, and though I have no doubts of its capabilities, I also wasn’t sure what sort of unforeseeable technical difficulties I could run in to. When the time for soundcheck came, another drummer got to the stage first with her acoustic drums, so we got those setup. But that is when things got interesting. The acoustics of the venue were really terrible. There was an echo that went on for minutes. We had a big fear of how to control the sound of live drums. After a brief attempt at a soundcheck, it already seemed like a bad idea. Then came the question:  Them: Judson, can we use your drums for all the bands tonight? Me: hmmmmmm… well, yes, of course, but are you sure that is a good idea? Them: Well let’s just give it a try Me: Ok!And so we set up the Roland drums for soundcheck. When all was set, I got behind the drums, and with one beat into the kick drum &gt;BOOM&lt; we all knew we struck gold. This. Drum set. Sounds. AMAZING. Live! Thusly, the rest of the night had amazing sounding rhythm which was super easy to mix into the volume of everyone else on stage.  Musical Talent of trivago: The Lineup: I am just blown away at the level of musical talent that exists in this company. Not to mention the courage it takes to play music in front of all your colleagues. The concert featured 8 acts: 6 bands, a DJ, and me. Here are some highlight photos from the evening. [gallery columns=”4” link=”file” size=”medium” ids=”19214,19189,19190,19191,19206,19192,19195,19196”] I didn’t get much video of the other bands, but be sure to check out this awesome video of Josito &amp; the Kids performing Daft Punk’s Get Lucky. These guys are amazing! My first stage performance in years: Then, late in the evening, after everyone was good and loosened up, having just listened to hours of amazing live music, my moment of truth came. It was time for me to hit the stage for the first time in Germany, and if I am being completely honest, this was my first true live performance since… I honestly can’t remember! (Seriously, I am sitting here trying to remember, and I just don’t remember. . ) Drummers typically sit in the back of the stage, behind the rest of the band. That is not an excuse to lack showmanship, but now my drums were pushed to the front edge of the stage and I was up here all alone. It was time for me to shine or sink. The crowd was full of energy, and it was my responsibility to keep them entertained.  Did I rehearse enough? Did I program the right drum sounds? Does the backing track work? Will the video backdrop work? These are all the questions which were in my head. But I was focused. I was prepared. I rehearsed, and now it was time to see if I still have what it takes. As I walked onto the stage, I slipped into character. For the next 32 minutes, I would be: DRUMSON.  Update: Checkout the official website for Drumson at https://drumson. de! Watch Video Footage from my First DRUMSON Performance: In all the years that I have played drums, I have no videos from a live performance, and I hardly have any photos. I certainly have no quality photos. Therefore, I asked a few friends to take some videos of my performance. The results were really amazing! Many people sent me videos and I was able to splice together this video recap of the show. Please excuse the unstable audio level, I think the phones had a difficult time keeping up with how loud the show was! Enjoy! (and please leave me your feedback in the comments section of this post!) :) Thank you to everyone who came out to support the music!: Thank you to all the other musicians, my friends, my colleagues, and especially to trivago for making this special night a reality, not just for me, but for everyone involved. The trivagoVibe happens twice a year and I hope that I will be able to perform at the next one. Until then, please leave me your thoughts in the comments below, and you can always reach me directly on Facebook and Twitter! "

    "title": "Edinburgh Castle Walking Tour",
    "body": "2018/02/13 - After having spent my morning taking a free walking tour, I decided it was worth buying a ticket to one of the afternoon paid tours. The tour organizer, SANDEMANs, had several to chose from but I was most interested in getting to know the Edinburgh Castle. So after a quick lunch on my own, I rejoined my trusty (and awesome) guide, Dave, and off we went together on the Edinburgh Castle walking tour. This tour runs daily in the afternoon. Check the SANDEMANs website for schedules and ticket information. Keeping things simple, our meeting point was at the same location as the free walking tour, on The Royal Mile. Our group was small, just 7 of us. After going through a quick round of introductions, we started our 5-minute walk up the hill to the Edinburgh Castle. Additional reading: Edinburgh FREE Walking Tour - All You Need to Know Before You Go In A Nutshell: Highlights - Enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides tell educational stories with flair and efficiency. The Edinburgh Castle is perhaps the most historically significant building in Scotland. The views from on top of the castle are incredible. Lowlights - If you were to have bad weather, there is almost no protection from the elements. If you have seen the British Crown Jewels in London, don’t get too excited about the Scottish Crown Jewels in Edinburgh Castle. Bottom line - The Edinburgh Castle walking tour is a great way to see the castle and ensure that you don’t miss any detail of the architecture or significant history. On a day with good weather, this is a perfect post-lunch activity. Edinburgh Castle Walking Tour: The official website of the Edinburgh Castle offers a lot of great information about the castle’s history and the independent tours you can take on your own. I recommend that you [download the official Edinburgh Castle Map” file=”. . /assets/images/2018/01/edinburgh-castle-orientation-map. pdf) now so that you can better orient yourself as you read this article and follow along on the map. The tour was nearly two hours from start to finish. When the tour concludes, you are free to explore the castle on your own and see some of the special exhibits, such as Scotland’s Crown Jewels which are on display in the castle. During the winter months, like when I was there, the tour concludes just before sunset, which can make for a spectacular view. Just plan accordingly because though the sunset is worth sticking around for, the temperature will drop very quickly. The Gatehouse at Edinburgh Castle: The Edinburgh Castle was built as an impenetrable and menacing fortress with deterrence kept in mind as the main message which the architecture should portray to any who cast a gaze upon it. Standing atop of vertical cliffs on three sides, the castle looks unapproachable. Despite that, it has been through 26 sieges, which makes it one of the most besieged places in Britain and among the most besieged places in the whole world. The new gatehouse is the first thing you see when you approach the Edinburgh Castle. You can see that the stone color and the architecture is rather different from the castle which lay behind. The reason for this was triggered by a visit of Queen Victoria who upon arrival was a bit disappointed at how unwelcoming the castle felt. She desired that there be a more royal castle aesthetic and so this new gatehouse was built in 1888, along with one tower on the main building which, though a small detail, does go a long way to making the Edinburgh Castle feel a bit more like the royal castles of England, such as Windsor Castle.  A coffee truck stands in front of the Gatehouse at Edinburgh Castle Prisoners of War: What really makes a castle? A dungeon! The Prisoners of War is a reenactment and multimedia experience in the Edinburgh Castle’s dungeon. Here, you get to explore the castle’s prison as it would have looked for centuries as the home to prisoners of war from all over the world. Alongside furnishings and personal items which were typical of prisoners who live here, there also audio clips playing throughout the room. As you listen, you get to learn about some of the lives and experiences of real prisoners, who were kept in the Edinburgh Castle dungeon. Prisoners came from all over the world, because of all sorts of conflicts, including the American Revolution.  Prisoners of War Exhibit at Edinburgh Castle Scotland’s Crown Jewels: At the highest point of Edinburgh Castle are the Scottish Crown Jewels, known as “The Honors of the Kingdom. ” You are not allowed to take photos inside, so a quick Google search can show you what it is you can expect here. I will just let you know now that if you have seen the crown jewels in London, this exhibit is not to be compared. In a lot of ways, Scotland’s crown jewels are more significant because they have a longer history. But they are not as refined and glamorous as the crown jewels that you will find at the Tower of London. Leading up to seeing the crown jewels is an exhibit chronicling the history of the monarchy and other various royal families and dynasties of Scotland. The whole exhibit is done very well. Unfortunately, I didn’t have very much time left to spend in the castle so I had to rush through all of that fairly quickly. You should give yourself at least 20 to 30 minutes to enjoy The Honors of the Kingdom exhibit.  Sign leading to The Honours of The Kingdom Exhibit at Edinburgh Castle Mons Meg - 510mm Caliber Cannon: The Mons Meg is a 500-year-old siege cannon. Its 20-inch (510mm) barrel size makes it one of the largest-caliber cannons in the world. Though only fired a few times, and usually for ceremonial reasons, the 175 kilograms (386 lb) stone cannon balls are proven to have a consistent range of around 2 miles (3 km). The last time Mons Meg was fired with ammunition was in 1680 to celebrate the arrival of James, Duke of Albany and York, who would later become King James VII. On this occasion, the barrel burst open and it has not been capable of munitions firing ever since. However, it is fired still today once a year on Hogmanay (new year) to mark the beginning of the fireworks display. Of course, now it just fires blanks.  Mons Meg at Edinburgh Castle Scottish National War Memorial: Another recent addition to the Edinburgh Castle is the Scottish National War Memorial. The memorial was opened in 1927 and pays tribute to all fallen soldiers of Scotland in both World Wars and conflicts since. Presumably, it was first built with the intention of memorializing soldiers of the first World War only, since the second war had not yet been fought. After World War II, 50,000 Scottish names were added to the building’s roster. The exterior of the memorial has been designed with the Edinburgh Castle aesthetic kept in mind. As this rests atop one of the highest points of the castle’s grounds, it is very visible from afar and so the architecture is intended to blend in. The interior, on the other hand, is almost art deco in style and feel much more like a modern memorial of sorts. The flags of Scottish regiments hang throughout. Under each flag are thick books on display with the names of all those who have served in each regiment and who have died in service.  Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle St Margaret’s Chapel: The oldest building in all of Edinburgh, St Margaret’s Chapel is a simple construction atop the Edinburgh Castle complex. The chapel was built in the 12th century and is thought to be a place of worship for St. Margaret herself. Though there is some debate about that due to the architecture giving hints of being built a bit later during the reign of her son, David I. In 1314 the castle was captured by Robert the Bruce and all the buildings inside, except for the Chapel, were destroyed. Though the chapel did fall in to disuse after that, it would eventually be renovated and put back in to use in the 19th century. It has held services on a fairly regular basis ever since.  St Margaret’s Chapel at Edinburgh Castle A Day Well Spent in Edinburgh: And that concludes my day in Edinburgh! I started with a free walking tour, visited the Museum of Scotland, had haggis for lunch, and then spent the afternoon walking around Edinburgh Castle where I ended up catching the sunset. I recommend this schedule for anyone who is visiting Edinburgh, either for your first day in town or if it is your only day in Edinburgh, as it was for me. Have you been to Edinburgh? Have you visited the Edinburgh Castle? I would love to have your feedback and impressions of the castle. Please feel free to leave a comment below or reach me directly on Twitter @judsonlmoore. "

    "title": "Edinburgh Free Walking Tour",
    "body": "2018/02/08 - I am believing more and more that the very best way to start any trip is with a free walking tour. These tours are offered in many of the world’s top destinations and are a great way to quickly orient yourself to the highlights a city has to offer. Most walking tours do not go inside of the sites, churches, and castles, but rather offer stories and a local’s perspective on what makes the city unique. If you kick off a weekend trip with a free walking tour, then you will be well-equipped to spend the next days getting to know the city in greater detail on your own. There are many Edinburgh free walking tours to choose from but I was most impressed with the promises claimed by the tour company SANDEMANs, which is a known brand across Europe. As I only had one day to enjoy Edinburgh, I thought it was a good decision to start my morning with their free walking tour and see where that would take me. The experience did not disappoint. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Very knowledgeable tour guides with a flair for theatrics and a passion for helping you understand Edinburgh and Scotland. Local knowledge quickly orientates you to the city and helps you plan the rest of your trip. Lowlights - Near the end of the tour there is a “coffee break” at their office where you are encouraged to buy tickets for paid tours. This would feel less scammy if after the coffee break there were another 1+ hours of walking, but there was only an additional 30 minutes or so. Bottom line - The value for money is undeniable and even the sales pitch to join a paid tour is perfectly appropriate. You can’t blame someone for using a free tour as bait to sell you something which also carries a value. All in all, free walking tours might cost you something, but what you get back in return far exceeds whatever you might pay. SANDEMANs Walking Tours: There were several tour companies offering free walking tours in Edinburgh but I was drawn to the sleek website and tour descriptions of SANDEMANs. I can’t say that they are the best since I haven’t compared them to other tour organizers in Edinburgh, but what I can say is that this was not my first free walking tour in Europe and in comparison to others I have taken it was at least equal to or better than any others that I have taken. There are a wide variety of free and paid tours offered by SANDEMANs in Edinburgh. You can check out the tours and schedules on the SANDEMANs website. I started my morning with the free walking tour and then I added the Edinburgh Castle tour to the afternoon. For both tours, I had the same guide; a really witty and very smart guy named Dave. I overheard a few other guides introduce themselves and though their dry nature might be preferred by some, I really enjoyed spending the day with Dave. If you get a chance to choose, I vote that you request Dave. I was really lucky with the weather the day I was in Edinburg but what is good to know is that all of SANDEMANs tours will go on as scheduled rain or shine. The tours meet up on The Royal Mile which is the main street connecting the Edinburgh Castle at one end with the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse on the other. The street in between is packed with shops and cafes, some of which even offer a discount to SANDEMANs ticket holders. St Giles’ Cathedral: The first stop on the free walking tour is St Giles’ Cathedral. This +900-year-old cathedral is the seat of the Church of Scotland and is the most important cathedral in the country. As you can see in the photo below, there is a very interesting architectural feature in the steeple, which is shaped like a crown, rather than a point reaching to the heavens above, as is typical in church architecture around the world. In nearly a millennium of history, you can imagine that St Giles’ Cathedral is tied to plenty of interesting and historically significant events. The one which Dave shared with us as his favorite story is about a street-seller named Jenny Geddes, who, during a religious service, became so upset at the archbishop that she threw her stool (the kind you sit on) at his head. This instantly turned in to a full-blown riot which spread across Scotland. These riots grew to become the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which included the English Civil War. St Giles’ Cathedral is also considered to be the mother church of Presbyterianism.  St Giles’ Cathedral in Edinburgh The Elephant House: The next few stops constitute a micro-tour inside of the tour. If I had to name it, it would be the Origins of Harry Potter Tour. For Harry Potter fans, the next few sites will carry special significance. Up first: The Elephant House. Pictured below, The Elephant House is a coffee shop inside of the Harvey’s Furniture Store building. If you look at the photo, the windows just above the building’s sign is the coffee shop. This is where J. K. Rowling wrote several of the early Harry Potter books. Where I am standing to take this photo is the Greyfriars Kirkyard, a graveyard where many recognizable names from the novels can be found. But more on that later. First, we have to go to school.  The Elephant House in Edinburgh where J. K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter George Heriot’s School: Across the graveyard from The Elephant House stands George Heriot’s School. This private school is 400 years old and was founded to offer a premier education to Scotland’s fatherless children. The castle-like architecture makes it stand out atop this hill which is across a valley from the Edinburgh Castle. As you can see pictured below, the square building has a tall tower in each corner. These four towers are each the home, or “house,” to a group of pupils. The house names are, Lauriston (green, after the school’s address, Lauriston Place), Greyfriars (white, named after the adjacent Greyfriars Kirk / Graveyard), Raeburn (red, after a famous former pupil, Henry Raeburn), Castle (blue, after Edinburgh Castle to the north). The combination of this school with the four houses and the dramatic view of the Edinburgh Castle on a cliff across the way, form the basis of J. K. Rowling’s vision for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  George Heriot’s School in Edinburgh Greyfriars Kirkyard: Turning back now to Greyfriars Kirkyard, this graveyard is home to many familiar names. Both names which hold real historical significance (James Douglas, Sir George McKenzie…) but also many names on these graves inspired characters in Harry Potter. For example, lawyer Thomas Riddell is the inspiration for Voldemort, and poet William McGonagall inspired the character of Professor McGonagall. So why did these graves inspire these characters? It is simple: graveyards offer authors all around the world with free and easy access to name inspiration for books. It is actually a common practice for authors to take names from graves, just as J. K. Rowling did.  Sir George McKenzie’s tomb in the Greyfriars Kirkyard Greyfriars Bobby Memorial Statue: This is the tale of loyalty to the highest degree. Greyfriars Bobby was a Skye Terrier which belonged to John Grey, the caretaker of the Greyfriars Kirkyard. John Grey passed away and his dog, Bobby, continued to stay by his human’s grave for the next 14 years, refusing to leave its side for any prolonged period of time. Bobby is now a well-known and well-documented figure in Scotland’s history. There are movies and books which retell the story of Bobby and this statue is a tribute to that loyalty. On the tour, we learned that the greatest honor a Scot can receive is to have a pub named after them. We saw pubs named after cultural icons, royalty, and politicians. Here, you can see the even Bobby has had this honor. On another funny note: the graveyard actually has signs now saying that dogs are not allowed. Oh how times change.  Greyfriars Bobby Memorial Statue National Museum of Scotland: Our walking tour concluded at the National Museum of Scotland. This is a great destination because from here you can check out the museum, which is also free. The museum is divided by era of Scottish history, starting with pre-historical origins, then lots of stuff about Vikings, Roman rule, the independence movement led by William Wallace, and then all the way up to modern-day Scotland with its engineering achievements and most notably, Dolly the Sheep! National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh Dolly The Sheep: Alright, the whole day has been pretty awesome up until now but this is for me the clear highlight. Dolly the Sheep is the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. She was born in 1996 and is the creation of the University of Edinburgh. This leap in genetics paved the way for other animals to be cloned, including pigs, deer, horses, and bulls. Tonight as I wrote this post, the news broke that two identical long-tailed macaques in China are the first ever primates to be cloned using the technique that created Dolly the sheep. And who knows, maybe one day I can get a clone of myself to help me write this blog! Dolly the Sheep in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh On a final note, the guides of this (and all) free walking tours are not paid at all for the tour they provide. They earn money only on tips from tour participants. So if you think the job they did was good, be sure to recognize them for that. Keeping in mind that a normal paid tour costs around 27£, offering a +10£ will go a long way for the guide and is really nothing at all for you as a participant. Be generous! Conclusion: So what do you think? Have you toured Edinburgh before? Have you been on a walking tour (paid or free) before? How do you think this one measures up? I would love to hear your thoughts.

    "title": "Things to Do in Dublin - A 3-day Weekend Itinerary",
    "body": "2018/02/03 - There are an incredible array of things to do in Dublin, so if you are visiting for a short weekend, it can be a bit overwhelming to figure out how to best make use of your time. I recently had the good fortune of spending a week in Dublin. While there, I visited a lot of places, some were undeniably incredible, while others I could have lived without. In this article, I highlight the very best from my time in Dublin and schedule it out for you in an easy to follow guide which can serve as an outline for things to do in Dublin as you plan your trip there. Should you have feedback, additions, or questions, please leave a comment at the end of this article so that I and others can help you have the best trip to Dublin ever! Outline of Things to Do in Dublin:  Day 1 - Royalty and whiskey         Dublin Castle (1. 5 hours)           Shopping in the old town (open-ended)           Selfies with Statues (open-ended)           Ha’penny Bridge (10 minutes)           Jameson Distillery on Bow St. (2 hours)           The Church Bar (open-ended)          Day 2 - A historic walk and a brewery tour          The Samuel Beckett Bridge (10 minutes)           St. Stephen’s Green (30 minutes)           Book of Kells + Trinity College (1 hour)           St. Patrick’s Cathedral (1 hour)           Get your family crest (5 minutes)           Guinness Storehouse (3-4 hours)           Temple Bar (open-ended)           Temple Bar whiskey tasting (optional)          Day 3 - A hike along the coast          DART train to Greystones + Cliff Walk (3-4 hours)           DART train to Howth for Fish and Chips (1-2 hours)       Mix and match this schedule to suit your needs and weather conditions. Getting the Most out of Dublin: There are shared bikes all across Dublin and you can get a 3-day pass for just €5 and use the bikes an unlimited number of times for up to 30-minutes each ride. Public transportation in Dublin will cost you more and be less convenient in most cases, but if you anticipate bad weather just keep some coins in your pocket for the bus as they don’t accept paper cash or cards, and they don’t give change. I also wouldn’t advise riding without a ticket, as the fine for getting caught can be as high as €1,000. Uber is also available throughout Dublin. That said, in the week I spent in Dublin, I never took the bus and I only took an Uber to the airport. Dublin is very walkable. Taking your own two feet is also the best way to explore the city. However, for a short weekend trip, you should probably take a bike, bus, or Uber to at least a few of the further out places, such as the Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson Distillery. I only say this as a timesaver and not because you couldn’t walk it if you wanted to. So consult Google Maps and make the decision that is best for your schedule. And last but not least, be aware that Ireland’s currency is the Euro and you will need an adaptor for a type-G electrical plug at 230v and 50Hz. I recommend this adaptor on Amazon. (affiliate link) Now, let’s get on with discussing all the things to do in Dublin for your awesome weekend trip! Day 1 - Royalty and Whiskey: Let’s take it a little bit easy on the first day. There are so many things to do in Dublin, but you just landed and you’ve not yet gotten acquainted with the city. There are a lot of things to stop and admire along the way and so this first day balances a set to-do list and the flexibility to just explore as you go. Today you will get your bearings and walk through many of the central hotspots. I recommend kicking off the day with breakfast wherever is near you. The “full Irish breakfast” is the go-to. Plus, you will get to try “black pudding,” a typical item on the Irish breakfast plate. You probably don’t want to know what it is. Just eat it and smile. After that, head to the Dublin Castle around opening time. From there, enjoy Dublin’s shopping district. Then we will go learn some about the modern history of Dublin at the Jameson Distillery and taste some Irish whiskeys. To close the day out, grab a beer at one of the most interesting bars in the world.

The castle as you see it today is relatively new, built in the last 200 years, but there has been a government building here for around 900 years. This was the seat of English, and later, British, government in Ireland until Ireland won independence in 1922. It is an active government building today, used mostly for formal state dinners and inauguration of the presidents of Ireland. There are self-guided and guided tours available of Dublin Castle. Much of the open exhibits allow for free-range exploration of the various rooms of state and apartments in the castle. There are rotating exhibit spaces as well which display some of Ireland’s finest artifacts. When I was visiting, the ceremonial Irish Sword of State was on display. This sword has been the symbol of Irish rule since 1681 and is officially part of the British Crown Jewels. It is on loan to the Dublin Castle from its normal display at the Tower of London.    When to visit: Early morning or after lunch     Time to Budget: 1. 5 hours     Official Website: dublincastle. ie  [gallery link=”file” size=”large” columns=”2” ids=”18875,18876”] The Irish Sword of State on Display at the Dublin Castle back to top Shopping in the old town: The shopping in Dublin is very good. Find Ha’penny Bridge on the map. The area south of the bridge is more historic old-town and higher-end shops. the area directly north of Ha’penny Bridge is a bit more bohemian and crafty. I found a lot of really cool shops in Dublin, but here are a few places I think everyone should check out: The Secret Book and Record Store15 Wicklow St, Dublin 2, D02 C924, IrelandCosy, independent bookshop offering a wide selection of new &amp; secondhand titles, plus CDs &amp; vinyl. Website Aran Sweater Market115 Grafton Street, Dublin 2, IrelandThe home of the famous Aran sweater, and original of Ireland! Sweaters, scarfs, and all sorts of other wool products. Website George’s Street ArcadeS Great George’s St, Dublin 2, Dublin, IrelandOrnate 1881 shopping plaza offering indie clothing boutiques &amp; food vendors, plus books &amp; jewelry. Website If you are interested in secondhand and vintage shops, then you must check out Siopaella. There are four locations in Dublin, all very near each other. Each location has a different specialty, ranging from furnishings and luxury goods to more vintage items.    When to visit: 9:30 am - 7:00 pm 7-days a week (normal opening times)     Time to Budget: Open-ended  The Secret Book and Record Shop in Dublin Ireland back to top Selfies with Statues: There are statues and monuments everywhere in Dublin. Playing a history-based Pokémon-like game to try and find them all will keep you quite busy and is a fun activity to play between all the other things to do in Dublin. Just keep your eyes open and snap a selfie every time you see a statue. If you do this, I promise you will have a really interesting compilation of photos across Dublin. There are too many statues for me to list or show, but pictured here is perhaps the most famous statue. This is of Molly Malone, a legendary character of the 17th century. It is unknown if Molly was a real person or not, but still, her life is forever memorialized in a famous Irish folk song, and now in this statue.    When to visit: Daylight hours     Wikipedia: List of Public Art in Dublin  Statue of Molly Malone in Dublin back to top Ha’penny Bridge: The River Liffey bisects Dublin into northern and southern halves. There are more than a dozen bridges in just the central area of Dublin and so you shouldn’t ever feel too trapped on one side, without an easy route across. The cast iron Ha’penny Bridge, dubbed as such because it was originally a toll bridge requiring pedestrians to pay in ha’pennies to cross it, is Dublin’s most historic bridge. Over 200 years old, it was built in 1816 as Dublin’s first pedestrian bridge. It would remain the only pedestrian bridge until the nearby Millennium Bridge was opened in 1999.    When to visit: Anytime     Time to Budget: Minutes  The historic Ha’penny Bridge in Dublin back to top Jameson Distillery on Bow St. : Ireland is home to whiskey and no other whiskey in the world is as well-known as Jameson. The Bow St. Distillery in central Dublin is the historic home of Dublin, but it is no longer an active distillery. However, this does not make the experience any less exciting. The distillery “tour” is called The Bow St. Experience because it is a multimedia 4-D immersion into the world of Jameson, whiskey, and Ireland (the 4th dimension is tasting whiskey!) I wrote a comprehensive review of the Jameson Distillery  which you should read if you plan to visit the Bow St. Distillery. Regardless of how you feel about whiskey, I can’t stress enough that this is more or less mandatory on the list of things to do in Dublin.    When to visit: Mid- or late-afternoon     Time to Budget: 2 hours     Official Website: jamesonwhiskey. com     Additional reading: Jameson distillery tour and whiskey tasting experience  The Jameson Distillery on Bow St. in Dublin back to top The Church Bar: With so many cool things to do in Dublin and so many eclectic pubs, it is difficult to pin down “the best” place to grab a pint. But for sure, it is not every day that you can enjoy a drink inside of a church! The Church is a bar, restaurant, and event venue brought to life from the neglected ruins of St. Mary’s Church which had been left empty for over 30 years. The refurbished space has kept the stained-glass windows and organ pipes in-place and relishes in the grand church architecture as the perfect place to let go of your sins for a night!

The architecture, however, is still what makes this a bridge worth checking out. The suspension cables and their mainstay form the shape of a harp, which is the national symbol of Ireland since the thirteenth century. If you can catch the bridge on a calm day, the water of the Liffey River casts the neatest reflection. You can almost see that in the picture below. Pro tip: there is a Starbucks right around the corner from here, as well as the Admiral William Brown Memorial (another statue selfie!)    When to visit: Anytime     Time to Budget: Minutes  The Samuel Beckett Bridge in Dublin is the shape of the Harp, Ireland’s national symbol back to top St. Stephen’s Green: This beautiful park in the heart of central Dublin is a great place to relax. Complete with botanical gardens, fountains, meticulous landscaping, and even a waterfall, a visit to St. Stephen’s Green is among the more relaxing things to do in Dublin. As you can see, I visited in the dead of winter, yet despite that, the park was full of life and still a beautiful place to hang out.    When to visit: Daylight hours     Time to Budget: 30 minutes  St. Stephen’s Green in central Dublin back to top Book of Kells + Trinity College: The Book of Kells is actually four books containing the Gospels of the New Testament. They were created around 800 A. D. in either Britain or Ireland and are famous for their richly adorned pages with intricate drawings depicting the characters of the Gospels. They have been on display at Trinity College since 1661. Only two volumes are on display at any given time and the page which the on-display books are open to changes fairly regularly as well so as not to cause damage to the books. When you enter into the Old Library of Trinity College, you will have to pay for a ticket to see the Book of Kells. First, you are guided through a very well-organized exhibit detailing the history of the books. The larger-than-life prints from the book which are on display here, are honestly the best view you will get of the books. After the exhibit, you go to a room where the books are and you can cast your gaze upon them for as long as you feel comfortable blocking someone else’s view. The Long Room of the Old Library: Departing from the room with the Book of Kells, you go upstairs to The Long Room of the Old Library.  This room is exciting for several reasons. I will list some highlights here:    Brian Boru Harp -  the oldest of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland     The rarest books - 200,000+ rare books, and in many cases very early volumes     The smell - if you like the smell of old books and libraries, this will top all the senses     Busts of Great Thinkers - the stacks are lined with amazing marble busts of great thinkers and philosophers     Proclamation of the Irish Republic - one of the last remaining copies of the 1916 document proclaiming Irish independence     Cool factor - this is just a really cool room to be in  The grounds of Trinity College are also very beautiful and historic. Take a walk around, check out the architecture, and if the weather permits, maybe have a picnic somewhere on the campus grounds.

However, and quite simply, as one of the most iconic cathedrals in the world, the St. Patrick’s Cathedral holds special significance for Irish and non-Irish alike. There is a ticketed fee to enter the church, which is generally something I oppose, but they make it worth while with special exhibits and some other displays which are not common in other European churches I have visited. Aside from the expected beautiful architecture and vast history of the church, there are also a number of exhibits detailing the impact the church has had on Irish culture. There are a number of artifacts on display around the church and quite a few multimedia stations playing short videos explaining the church’s impact on society. There are also some cool kid-friendly hands-on activities. The adjacent Saint Patrick’s Cathedral Choir School is the oldest such school in Ireland, now nearing its 600th anniversary. The choir performs twice daily during the week. Pro tip: St. Patrick’s Cathedral is an Anglican church, which means some of their service terminologies differ from other traditional churches. For example, they do not celebrate “mass” but instead, refer to the ”Eucharist. ” Knowing the difference between these words will go a long way in helping you blend in to the masses (pun intended!)    When to visit: Daylight hours (to see the stained glass windows better), or during any of these services held on weekdays:          9:00 Sung Matins - youth choir performance           11:05 Eucharist           17:30 Choral Evensong - youth choir performance           Time to Budget: 1 hour     Official Website: stpatrickscathedral. ie  Inside St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin back to top Get your family crest: This is a quick bonus at the St. Patrick’s Cathedral. The gift shop is actually quite nice and they have a section of all the family crests for the church’s members. People often ask me if I am Irish and I always say no, that I am more German and Danish. But here I found a crest for the Moore Family. This prompted me to fact-check my heritage and learn that indeed, I am a bit Irish. Opps. Well, I guess we learn something new every day! The Irish family crest for Moore back to top Guinness Storehouse: Yesterday we started hard with whiskey so today lets take it a bit easier and go for a “bit of the black stuff!” Guinness is every bit as important to the history, prominence, and development of Ireland as Jameson is. Here, at the Guinness Storehouse, you will experience a deeply immersive educational experience which is as much about the beer brewing process as it is about the history of Guinness and the impact this brewery had on Ireland’s industrial revolution. The storehouse is 1-part self-guided tour, 1-part museum, and 1-part hands-on experimentation. You even get to try your hand at making a perfect pour of a pint of Guinness. If you are interested in visiting the Guinness Storehouse, be sure to read my comprehensive review of the Guinness Storehouse. Similarly to the Jameson Distillery, I argue that a visit to the Guinness Storehouse is a must-do on this list of things to do in Dublin. If you can only do one or the other, then probably the Guinness Storehouse is the better experience, but both are very much worth visiting.    When to visit: Late afternoon     Time to Budget: 3-4 hours     Official Website: guinness-storehouse. com     Additional reading: Visiting the Guinness Storehouse  The gates of the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin back to top Temple Bar: Self-proclaimed as, “the friendliest watering hole in Dublin,” might be just about right, but for sure this is at least the most famous of all the bars in Dublin. So what better place to end our day? One of the best things about this bar is that they have live Irish music 7-days a week from 2:00 pm until closing time. I stopped in here a few times during my stay in Dublin and I was blown away each time by the amazing music being performed. There is no cover charge. Temple Bar restaurant is also quite good and this is a great place to try a traditional dinner of oysters and Guinness! If you feel like trying some more whiskeys, Temple Bar has Ireland’s largest selection of whiskey (more on that next). So no matter what is on your list of things to do in Dublin tonight, you can find it all at Temple Bar.

They have a wide array of whiskeys on display and for sale. They have everything, ranging from Temple Bar whiskey which is made in-house, all the way up to the rarest hundred-plus-year-old whiskeys which cost more than $2500 a bottle. Their knowledgeable staff is super friendly and happy to give you a history tour around the room. I highly recommend this. They also have a whiskey tasting menu which I found to be quite comprehensive. The best part, though, at least on my visit, is that there was a TV in the back of the room playing Nick Offerman’s ‘Yule Log’ for the whole evening. Clearly, these people are amazing.    When to visit: Evening     Time to Budget: 10 minutes - 1 hour     Official Website: thetemplebarpub. com  Whiskey Tasting at the Temple Bar Distillery Store back to top Day 3 – A hike along the coast: I hope you are not yet tired of walking because everything else has just been a warmup to get to today! As great as the last days’ activities have been, I think this day is the most rewarding. Be aware that good weather is necessary, so if you need to rearrange your schedule to accommodate this on day one or day two, go for it. We will take the train to explore the Irish coastline and get our hiking boots a little dirty. At the end of the day, we will be well rewarded with some of the best fish and chips in all of Ireland. One tip about today, if you will fly out of Dublin tonight, then you should take your luggage to the DART station. They have luggage storage there. Just be sure to pick up your luggage after hiking in Greystones while on your way to Howth. From Howth, it is much easier to go directly to the airport than it would be to go back to the city center and then to the airport. (https://goo. gl/maps/YDsvv4pj4922) Click on image to open interactive map on Google. ” %} DART train to Greystones + Cliff Walk: One of the best things to do in Dublin is to get out of Dublin! The DART is Dublin’s regional train for commuters. The main station in Dublin is Connolly Station, which has the best options for luggage storage and other services. The endpoints of the DART line following the coast are Greystones to the south and Howth to the north. You will need to buy a day pass for the train. As of this writing, it costs €12. 00 per person. Once you have your day pass and have stored any luggage you need to put away, hop on the next southbound train to Greystones. The ride lasts about an hour and the views are spectacular. When you arrive at Greystones, head over toward the beach, and when you are ready, walk along the coast back toward the north (so that the water is to your right side). Within a few minutes, you will come to a path marked with a sign, “Cliff Walk / Bray. ” Bray is the next town to the north and is your destination. If you don’t find this sign, no worries, just take the sidewalks and paths closest to the water until you get there. This cliff walk is really popular, so you can also look for the stream of people walking toward you. The cliff walk is a well-maintained trail along the coast. The views and the fresh air are a great reprise from the city life. Just enjoy and go at your own pace! When you arrive at Bray, there are a number of coffee shops and takeaway cafes. Just don’t ruin your appetite, because in a few hours you will be eating the best fish and chips!    When to visit: Morning     Time to Budget: 3-4 hours     Official Website: irishrail. ie  View from the Cliff Walks of Greystones back to top DART train to Howth for Fish and Chips: The train from Greystones to Howth takes about two hours. If you need to stop off in Dublin to pick up luggage you stored there, then expect to have to wait for a little for the next train to Howth. Upon arrival in Howth, you have a few options. You can explore the peninsula which forms the northern border of the Bay of Dublin. The area is very walkable and there are a lot more hiking opportunities if time and daylight allow. Howth is a fishing community and so this is a really authentic place to get fish and chips. Directly under the train station is a restaurant called The Bloody Stream. The atmosphere is cool, the location is very convenient, the prices are much more reasonable than some of the other nearby restaurants, and the fish and chips are the best I have ever had. While you wait for your food, read the history on the back of the menu to learn about why they are called The Bloody Stream. Hint: Vikings.    When to visit: Afternoon or evening     Time to Budget: 1-2 hours     Official Website: bloodystream. ie  Fish and Chips at The Bloody Stream in the Howth Railway Station back to top Relax. Smile. You did it!: Mix and match a schedule that works for you and the weather you encounter. Of course, this list of things to do in Dublin is not fully comprehensive and it fully omits any mention of what will really make your trip to Dublin special: you! Just relax, have a good time, and live every moment to the fullest. That is the only thing you need to make sure that whatever you do in Dublin, it will be a trip to remember!

    "title": "Visiting the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin",
    "body": "2018/01/15 - The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin is the traditional home of the world’s most famous stout beer: Guinness. This 200+ year-old city within a city is a major contributor to modern Irish history and to the island’s economy and world fame. Guinness is known the world over as a premium stout. It’s not the kind of beer you drink every day or in large quantity. It stands out as being quite different from any other beer you will find because it is black, creamy, and served on nitro, which means you also have to have a fairly sophisticated setup just to pour it properly. So how does a beer with so many complications and which is so limited in drinkability end up being a global powerhouse business? That is exactly what I came to the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin to find out. Additional reading: Jameson distillery tour and whiskey tasting experience In A Nutshell: Highlights - The facilities are recently renovated but still have that industrial-era charm. The experience is about much more than just beer but also helps visitors understand the history of beer in general. The experience is extraordinarily well curated. Lowlights - The Guinness Storehouse is a museum and not a brewery. The start of the tour is a bit chaotic without a clear start point. Most of the experience is self-guided. Bottom line - The space which the Guinness Storehouse occupies is very impressive and will leave visitors more knowledgeable about Guinness, beer, Dublin, and Ireland. A perfect way to spend 3-4 hours in Dublin. The Guinness Storehouse is the world’s largest beer glass: The first thing you will notice when you walk into the Guinness Storehouse is that it is very (I mean VERY) large. It is a tall building, 7-stories of museum, which is hollow on the inside, plus a rooftop panoramic bar. Modern renovations have lined the interior atrium with glass panels, effectively forming the world’s largest beer glass. If filled, it would hold something like 17 million pints of Guinness! Unfortunately, this design was impossible to photograph, so you will have to check it out yourself to see what I am talking about. We booked our tickets online so we had a specific time to arrive. Something to note, however, is that this is more for capacity management and NOT a reservation. The experience starts with a welcome speech which takes place every 15 minutes. You could even skip this and walk straight into the first exhibit if you wanted. So, if you are on your way here and are running late, don’t sweat it! You will be just fine. After the introduction speech, we were directed to the start of the experience. The first exhibit is all about the ingredients which make Guinness. Of course, these are the standard four ingredients of all beer: barley, hops, yeast, and water. What was so interesting about the way Guinness displays these items were simply by their scale. The barley was a field of grains probably 30’ x 30’ with multimedia displayed on screens in the center as well as projected onto the ingredients. As you walk around the field, the wall to the outside covers agricultural and historical facts about barley in society. The next little section were stalks of hops growing out of the ground from below where we were walking and stretching out of sight above us into the floors above. When we came to the water, it was a massive waterfall pouring into a vast pool. All of this was to set up what came next: the brewing process. (Step 11 is an on-going theme throughout the Guinness Storehouse. ) Guinness as an industrial revolution leader: A phrase which came up many times at the Guinness Storehouse was that this space was a city within a city which shaped Ireland’s position in the world during the Industrial Revolution. The whole space has a strong vibe resonating with Industrial Revolution-era aesthetic and machinery. Though much of this has been updated to modern machines and materials, it is super interesting to see some of the original brewing machinery which made it possible for Guinness to be brewed at scale. I must say that of all the breweries I have visited around the world, none have showcased their industrial roots quite like this.  Detail and impressive scale at every step of the way: The exhibit which I found most interesting was the area pictured below with all of the wooden casks which Guinness is aged in. I don’t often think about beer as being aged in oak, but that actually is fairly common. In Düsseldorf, where I live now, it is common to get alt beer directly from the cask (but that story is for another day). What most impressed me here was a demonstration of how the barrels are made. The tradesmen which make wooden barrels are called coopers. Coopers are a great example of how to make something exceedingly complicated look super easy when you have the right tools and the right skills. This exhibit area features a large stack of Guinness barrels, a display of original cooper tools, and a video which shows the whole process, start to finish, of a cooper making one of these barrels. Fascinating.  Cultural impacts of Guinness: There is a whole floor dedicated to Guinness advertising. Apparently, Guinness has some hilarious ads. Many of the ads depict exotic animals like seals and toucans propping up a Guinness on their noses. There actually was a real circus seal that could run around the room while balancing a full glass of Guinness on its nose without spilling it. I imagine that practice has ended, but the videos were quite funny. Probably my favorite ad said “A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,” which then, of course, had a fish riding a bicycle, followed by “not everything in black and white makes sense,” and then some call to drink Guinness. Attention-grabbing, to say the least. Part of the claim in the advertising section of the museum is that these Guinness ads changed the advertising landscape by making a shift away from simply stating facts about a product, and instead focusing on humor, emotion, and merely alluding to the qualities of their product. The culture piece which I gravitated to was the one which impacts my daily work in the technology sector: the constant availability of beer at work. Every day at 10am, the official taste-testers at Guinness have to take a drink. This is only about quality assurance, of course, but hey, someone has to do it! A little taste of the black stuff: Speaking of taste testing, it is time for us to get a bit of the black stuff! We get ushered into a room which is nearly identical to The Television Room in Willy Wonka where he makes his television chocolate. This space is a stark difference from what we have experienced so far: plain white walls, no branding, just a white room which bright lighting and a bar with some Guinness taps. There is a guide which welcomes us to the room and asks us to walk around the room to smell the four “aroma chambers” which are each emitting a gentle fog and smell of Guinness at different stages of brewing. We are asked to describe what we smell. The room responds with all sorts of “notes of. . ” and “hints of. . ” and other pallet terminology which mostly just annoy me when describing beer, but hey, we are at a tasting, so what do you expect? And then finally, we get to drink some Guinness! Unfortunately, as you can see from this image, it is the world’s smallest beer.  How to achieve a perfect pour of Guinness: But the drinking isn’t over yet! The last stop on the tour is the Guinness Pouring Academy. Here, we learned what makes a Guinness tap different from a normal beer tap. I already knew that Guinness is served on nitro, rather than CO2, but there is more to it than that. The perfect pour of Guinness demands that you first fill the glass about 2/3 by pulling the tap toward you. Then you let this settle for a minute and when you continue filling the glass you push the tap in which actually pours Guinness without nitro! It is this combination that creates the trademark creamy head on top of the glass.  Plan a visit to the Guinness Storehouse: A visit to the Guinness Storehouse will set you back about $20 and is a great way to fill a rainy afternoon in Dublin.

    "body": "2018/01/14 - When visiting Dublin there are a few staple must-do activities and tourist traps you simply have to fall in to. Drink a Guinness? Check! Go for a hike? Check! Have a whiskey distillery tour and whiskey taste testing? Check check! Welcome to the home of Ireland’s most famous whiskey: The Jameson Distillery on Bow St. There are a number of activities and tours you can take while visiting The Jameson Distillery but I am going to focus on two: The Jameson Distillery Tour, and the Premium Whiskey Tasting. Now, don’t get me wrong, I was raised in Kentucky (hint, that is foreshadowing. . ) but I have never been to a proper whiskey taste testing. I have done more than my share of vineyard weekends and even a tequila tasting at the Jose Cuervo distillery in Tequila, Mexico, but this is my first sit down to learn how to fully appreciate the finer side of whiskey. A dear and lifelong friend has called me “Jameson” for about as long as I can remember, so it feels about right that I should have this first experience at The Jameson Distillery! Further Reading: Visiting the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin. Tour and experience review. In A Nutshell: Highlights - The facilities are recently renovated but still have that industrial-era charm. The location of The Jameson Distillery make it easy to get in and out of. There are lots of opportunities to eat and drink in and near The Jameson Distillery. The experience is about much more than just whiskey but also helps visitors understand the history of Irish whiskey in general and interesting facts about Dublin’s history. Lowlights - The tour omits any active area of The Jameson Distillery, so it is not really a functional space in any way, just a really nicely themed museum. Bottom line - The Jameson Distillery on Bow St. is a great way to spend a few hours in Dublin during poor weather or after the sun sets. It offers something for everyone regardless of whiskey appreciation and to understand the history of Jameson, is to understand the history of Dublin. Take the Jameson Distillery Bow St. Tour in Dublin: The tour of The Jameson Distillery is called The Bow St. Experience. I think this is for two reasons. The obvious one is that the distillery is located on Bow St. The second is that it is not a distillery anymore, rather it is a museum of the original distillery, thus, it is an “experience” and not really a distillery tour. According to the Jameson website, every drop of Jameson is produced in Midleton, Cork, about a 3-hour drive away. The tour consists of four parts. The first part is mostly about waiting for the second part, but you wait along a wall with a very nice timeline of Jameson history. Much of this is to understand the origins of Jameson, the life of the founder, John Jameson, and the impact that this city within a city has had on Dublin, Ireland, and the world. Once you work your way down the timeline, you find yourself in a small theater in the round where the “Jameson Ambassador” will tell the story of Jameson Whiskey with the aid of some astoundingly well-engineered visual and audio aids. Walt Disney would be proud! Now that we have gained a theoretical knowledge of all things related to Jameson Whiskey, we move into another room where we get to put our hands on what makes Jameson, Jameson: the ingredients! In the process room, our ambassador guides us through an interactive explanation of the distilling process. We get to touch the ingredients, smell the stages of distillation, and even come to appreciate the difference between different woods used to make the barrels which infuse whiskey with their smokey quality. Turns out that all Jameson whiskey is aged in recycled bourbon barrels from American bourbon makers.  After all of this, we make our way into yet another room where we get a free taste testing of whiskey! Guests are taught how to properly drink whiskey, what qualities to look (and taste) for, and we got to compare three kinds of whiskey. The first two whiskeys were not labeled and so we were asked to guess what they were. I was surprised that I correctly nailed exactly which whiskeys they were. The first was Johnny Walker Red Label. When I said this, the ambassador asked, “what qualities of the pallet and nose helped you determine that?” I simply said, “because it is bad!” Everyone laughed. With the second unknown whiskey, I gave it one smell and shouted out, “Jack Daniel’s!” Which was correct. When again asked what gave it away for me, I said, “because it is amazing!” Again, everyone laughed. I don’t know if it is because of my Kentucky roots, but Jack Daniel’s has always been my favorite. I don’t pretend to say it is the best whiskey, but it is my drink of choice. We then moved on to the third tasting, which was, of course, Jameson. I think having back to back whiskeys is pretty rough on the pallet and I am not so convinced that tasting them like this is really the best idea, but still, I appreciated the opportunity and it was a great way to round off the end of the Jameson Distillery Bow St. Tour. Learn more about this tour and book tickets for your visit on the Jameson website.  A premium whiskey tasting at the Jameson Distillery Bow St. : Now on to part two of my experience: the premium whiskey tasting at the Jameson Distillery This tasting was actually a pretty amazing experience. For one, the location is in John Jameson’s original office. It has been renovated but keeps the general essence of the original office. John Jameson had a pretty awesome office apparently because it has a full bar in it! Space is limited to 18 people per tasting. This is a great activity to organize for small groups, team events, and bachelor parties, which is what I walked in to. I was the one man out in a room full of dudes celebrating the pending marriage of one of their friends. But I would say this made the tasting even that much more fun. In this tasting, we were provided four whiskeys to try, all of which come from Jameson. They were (in order of testing):  Jameson Original Jameson Crested Jameson Distillery Edition Jameson Black BarrelI will quickly share what I learned about each of these. Jameson Irish Whiskey (original): Triple distilled, twice as smooth, one of a kind. Jameson Irish Whiskey is a blended Irish whiskey which has been aged in oak casks for a minimum of 4 years. The base Jameson pot still whiskey is blended with a delicate grain whiskey, allowing them to mature and inherit the nuttiness of sherry casks balanced with the fragrant vanilla of bourbon casks (see the ingredients image above). The final product is sold in the Jameson iconic green-glass bottle.  Nose - A light floral fragrance, peppered with spicy wood and sweet notes.  Taste - The perfect balance of spicy, nutty and vanilla notes with hints of sweet sherry and exceptional smoothness. Learn More and buy Jameson Original Jameson Crested: Until the 1960s, Jameson could be purchased by the barrel. This allowed for “bonders” to bottle the whiskey on their own, but the temptation to water down the product proved to be too tempting for too many. Therefore, the practice of selling barrels was ended. The Jameson Crested edition is a celebration of the whiskey from those earlier times. The Jameson Crested is created in much the same way as the original but it is left to mature longer in the sherry casts than in the bourbon barrels.   The high proportion of sherry casks in the blend delivers vivid sherry &amp; hearty pot still notes with some spice and a hint of melon &amp; ginger. Full bodied with soft delicate sherry undertones, toasted wood, perfectly balanced with fruit, spice and some chocolate notes.  Nose - Vivid sherry pot still aroma.  Taste - Delicate sherry undertones &amp; toasted wood, with fruit, spice &amp; chocolate notes.  Finish - Warm lingering sherry. Learn more and buy Jameson Crested Jameson Distillery Edition: The distillery edition is only available for consumption and purchase directly from the Jameson Bow St. Distillery in Dublin. I found the flavor to be similar to the original Jameson but slightly more citrusy. This whiskey has a bit more of a refined taste with a smoother finish. The initial bite is also dampened a bit, probably by the addition of a little extra single malt.  Nose -  Mango, cream, ginger, buttered corn, sugarcane Taste -  Orange, brown sugar, ginger, peach, salt Finish - Corn, sugar, arugula, oak, vanilla, ginger ale, butterscotchThe Jameson Distillery Edition is available only on-site in the Bow St. Distillery. Jameson Black Barrel: This stuff is like lighter-fluid. Really, it is the moonshine of Jameson whiskeys. We tasted it first straight, and then with a few drops of water. There was a huge difference. The name comes from the twice-charred bourbon barrels which this whiskey is aged in. This gives the finished product a much richer flavor and a lot more intensity than the other bottles of Jameson.  Nose - Time spent maturing in these barrels leads to intensified aromas of butterscotch, fudge, and creamy toffee.  Taste - Nutty notes are in abundance alongside the smooth sweetness of spice and vanilla.  Finish - Enjoy the richness and intensity of toasted wood and vanilla. Learn more and buy Jameson Black Barrel Final thoughts on the taste testing: At the conclusion of the tasting, our ambassador asked everyone in the room to declare which was their favorite. No one said that the black barrel was their favorite. There was probably a fairly equal split among the other three bottles for being the class favorite, with a possible leader of the Jameson Crested, which I also favored. All in all, this was a really nice experience and one I am glad to have had. It was worth the 30 Euros and 4o minutes. To top it off, the taste testing also came with a really nice book about Jameson with the full history and recipes for whiskey cocktails you can make at home. Unlike the distillery tour, participants of the taste testing also received a 10% discount at the gift shop.

    "title": "My most traveled year. A photo review of 2017.",
    "body": "2018/01/01 - 2017 was a whirlwind year: America inaugurated a new president, Brittan triggered article 50, and North Korea tested ballistic missiles, all the while, the globe continues to get warmer. With headlines like those, it makes any accomplishments or activities in my life seem hardly worth noting. Perhaps the best thing about being an Expat in Germany is that it is like living on cloud 9, so despite being a news and politics junkie, I maintain a high degree of happiness. So what am I doing with my abundance of happiness? Well, 2017 was my most-traveled year, having visited 11 countries. I also started a new job at trivago as a product owner overseeing development of the trivago website. This was a great career change as it is making good use of my life’s work tinkering with and passion for web development. I changed apartments and now live directly in the beautiful historic center of Düsseldorf. I also made some progress connecting with my community via an organization which teaches web development skills to refugees. All in all, 2017 was an incredible year and it will be hard to improve upon that in 2018. Of course, I do accept the challenge. In reflection of the last year, here is a month-by-month recap of some highlights. January - Myrtle Beach as spokesperson for trivago: The new year started off strong. In January I attended a hospitality trade fair in South Carolina where I was a spokesperson for trivago’s business tools. The three colleagues I traveled with were all amazing people and I have kept them as close friends throughout the year. Here is a sunset selfie on the empty Myrtle Beach off-season shoreline.  February - Oldenburg for a Kohlfahrt: I often talk about how my life’s story began when I was a Rotary Youth Exchange Student in Germany. In February I had an opportunity to return for the first time to where it all started in Oldenburg. My very favorite German tradition is native to this northwest region of Germany. It is called a Kohlfahrt, which translates roughly to “kale walk. ” Winter time is high-season for kale in this part of the world. To celebrate the end of the winter kale harvest, locals go on a Kohlfahrt. We loaded up a wagon with beer and schnapps, tied shot glasses around our necks on a string, and headed out into the countryside for a few hours of winter wilderness walking and drinking games. The whole thing ends at a restaurant where there is live music, more drinks, lots of food, and of course: kale! February (part 2) - Amsterdam: Alright, I am going to fudge my own rule here and list two highlights for February. My girlfriend Britta, and I went to Amsterdam for a weekend. Despite having really bad luck with the weather, we had an amazing time exploring the city and seeking shelter in museums and pubs. I learned that the Netherlands is famous for cheese and ate my weight in free samples at the Amsterdam Cheese Museum. In literally our last 30 minutes in Amsterdam, the clouds broke and we got a peak of sunlight. Here is one of the few photos I was able to take in our final minutes in Amsterdam.  March - Morocco for a week: From the High Atlas mountains to the ancient bazaars of Fez, a week in Morocco was a highlight of 2017, not just March. Despite still being in recovery from a knee surgery just three months earlier, I was able to keep up with some light hiking in the mountains and walking throughout the rugged terrain of the cities. I had no appreciation for how vast and diverse Morocco was until I visited. Morocco is home to the second-highest mountain in all of Africa, the oldest pedestrian-only city center in the world, pristine coastline, and the Sahara Desert. With only a week in Morocco, we covered a lot of territory and saw a lot of the country from a train window, but there is much more to see. I am already preparing plans for a return trip to Morocco in 2018. Stay tuned! April - Neanderthal Valley Hiking: The Neanderthal Valley is located less than 10 miles from my home in Düsseldorf. This region is full of farmland and limestone quarries, both of which make a dramatic impression on the landscape. Undoubtedly, the Neanderthal Valley is best known for being the home of the 40,000-year-old Neanderthal Man, which as it turns out is not 1 person, but a group of neanderthal remains found in the valley from which the famed Neanderthal Man’s reconstruction has been created. The area also has a very well-organized and well-maintained trail network which provides you with a front row seat to the beauty of nature, the abandoned quarries, and endless fields of rapeseed, which, when in-season blanket the Earth in the most spectacular golden carpets. Here is me showing how stoked I am to be with the rapeseed.  May - Mom visits and we meet my German host family: Unequivocally, the single best thing to happen in all of 2017 was that my mom came to visit me in Germany! We had a blast exploring Germany for two weeks. Among our destinations, I introduced mom to Oldenburg. While there, I also had a reunion with my host parents. It was my first time to see them in 17 years and it was the first time for my host parents to meet my mom. It was a special moment in the middle of a very special trip. Also: I got a haircut! June - Whitewater rafting and canyoning in Austria: trivago has these cool shared-cost events called “experience academies. ” They are typically 3-4 day trips to any number of interesting destinations which offer interesting experiences. They have taken employees sailing, to CERN, and on this occasion, to Austria for whitewater rafting and canyoning! Unfortunately, I don’t have any photos of the main activities, but I can say this: whitewater rafting was a lot more chill than I expected, and canyoning is quite possibly the most difficult physical thing I have ever attempted. We had a free day so we went to Area 47, a massive outdoor water and adventure park surrounded by huge vertical mountains, where I was able to snap a few shots. Here you can see some of the more impressive waterslides from the park.  July - Spartan Race: Spartan Races take place all over the world and are a true feat of strength. They involve a 5km (minimum) run with dozens of obstacles in the way. The obstacles include climbing, jumping, crawling, swimming, lifting, spear-throwing, and other feats. If you fail at an obstacle, you have to do 50 burpees. To say this was difficult for me would be quite the understatement. But I finished and it was awesome. I look forward to running again next year with the trivago team! August - The Mosel Valley: Germany’s wine country: Every year, I go on a wine-tasting weekend with my German friends. This year we went to the Mosel Valley and tried a dozen different kinds of rieslings. I don’t particularly like white wine or sweet wine, so I struggled a bit to get through the wine tastings, but the geography around the Mosel River is breathtaking and we could not have asked for better weather.  September - Nordic cruise to Norway and Denmark: trivago really empowered a lot of personal travel for me this year. In September, trivago booked out a whole cruise ship and took all employees on a private cruise to Norway and to Denmark. The cruise had live music every night. The destinations had curated activities. The train to and from the boat was a dance club on rails. If you haven’t read it yet, check out my article about trivago on Tour 2017 and see the video of the party train. Here I am in Norway with a moose.  October - Northern Italy and the most stunning sunset: To celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, which began in Germany when Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of a church in Wittenberg, the German government saw it fit to give us a 5-day weekend. Woo hoo! So I headed off to Italy with a group of friends. We rented a car and road-tripped through Milan, Lake Como, Bergamo and Parma. We drank a lot of wine, ate lots of pizzas and pasta, we got lost in the world’s largest hedge maze, and we took in lots of sights.  The whole trip was incredible, but nothing compares with this sunset we saw over Lake Como. This photo has no filter or alterations and does no justice to the majesty of the experience. I have never seen cloud formations like this, or so many colors paint the sky in such a way. I seriously doubt I will ever experience such natural beauty ever again.  November - Going home to Kyrgyzstan: From 2011-13 I served in the United States Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan where I worked to onboard rural journalists to the internet via mobile phones. The project was and continues to be, a huge success. As a result, I was invited to attend a journalism conference in Bishkek in November to mark the 10th anniversary since the beginning of developing community media in Kyrgyzstan. Though the conference was just one day, I stuck around for two weeks to reunite with friends, family, and this wonderful place I used to call home. Funny thing: it still felt like home.  December - A winter break in Palma de Mallorca: Ending up the year is yet another awesome trip which was made possible by trivago. We have an office on the Spanish Mediterranean Island of Mallorca. Each employee can work from Palma for up to 1 month per year at the company’s expense. trivago has a beautiful villa which served as my home for two weeks as I escaped the German winter. Britta came to visit for a few days. Among other explorations of the island, we rented some really nice road bikes and went for a long ride down the coast.  Happy New Year and all the best in 2018!: My 2018 is already off to a crazy start. In the next 6 weeks, I will visit Ireland, Scotland, London (twice), Switzerland, and Amsterdam, all while continuing to grow in my career at trivago and living life here in Düsseldorf. I wish you and yours a very happy new year! I hope that 2017 was great for you and that 2018 will be even more wonderful. Please, feel free to leave a comment below with your new year reflections! "

    "title": "What I have learned about my Peace Corps legacy in Kyrgyzstan",
    "body": "2017/11/13 - I just returned from a 2-week trip to Kyrgyzstan. “Kyrgyz-what???” you say? Exactly. Well, if you have been paying attention to my writings the last years then you will recall that I served in the US Peace Corps from 2011-2013 in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan is a gorgeous and remote country in the heart of Central Asia. Europeans who visit the country refer to it as the Switzerland of Central Asia. The history of the country is steeped in nomadic traditions, and it was once a major route along the Silk Road. During my time there, I came to truly love the country and adore its people and culture. I had not been back since the end of my service over 4 years ago, so it was now high-time that I make it back that way. In the Peace Corps, we don’t really expect that we will ever understand the full breadth or impact of the work we do. This is especially true of the organization’s roots over 50 years ago. Even so, there are well-documented cases of the ripple effect Peace Corps Volunteers have made around the world, sometimes in the most unexpected ways. While reuniting with friends and colleagues this last week, I learned a few things which I did not know about my own legacy in Kyrgyzstan. Some of these I suspected, while others were a complete shock. 250,000 readers and growing: My initial assignment with the Peace Corps was in the remote western province of Kyrgyzstan called Talas, where I worked with Central Asia’s premier community radio station. I did some basic programming work with them and worked out some best-practices on their blog. Moreover, I worked with them to provide trainings to other up-and-coming community radio stations around Kyrgyzstan. After a few months of this, I started to get an idea. I observed that many of the eager people we were training in radio broadcast journalism did not have radio stations to return home to, and the prospects of those being built anytime soon seemed quite low. Additionally, it was obvious that nearly everyone in Kyrgyzstan had a smartphone and was keeping in touch with the news and their friends via phone apps. Therefore, I came up with the idea that we should provide phones and an online platform to these journalists so that they could publish stories today, while they continue to progress toward building a radio station tomorrow.  Judson delivering the keynote at a media conference in Bishkek in November 2017. KyrgyzMedia. com was born in 2013 and now reaches more than 120,000 readers each year all around the world. A remarkable achievement for these journalists who all come from rural parts of Kyrgyzstan! I couldn’t be prouder that this project’s origins are from an idea that I had and fought for, wrote the original project plan for and even secured the first rounds of funding for. However, the success and achievements are, and always have been, with the journalists who are utilizing the technology to tell their story. Last week, I was afforded the opportunity to present this history and success to the journalists at a media conference in Bishkek, where I was a guest of the conference at the invitation of Deutsche Welle. I am eternally grateful to their support of the project, and of course to the journalists who saw value in this concept and who have owned it ever since.  Year over year growth in articles read on KyrgyzMedia. com Improvements in medical facilities: One morning, just before my first departure from Kyrgyzstan in 2013, my appendix decided it was time to leave my body. I had an emergency appendectomy in Kyrgyzstan and it was not a fun experience at all. In fact, it was downright terrible. As a writer constrained to a hospital bed for a week, I did just what you might expect and documented the whole experience. In my writing, I strived to compliment the skills and achievement of the medical teams, who were indeed great. However, they had very limited resources to work with. The purpose of my article was more to shine a light on the awful conditions of Kyrgyzstan’s top surgical center in hopes that it might be a contributing factor to future improvements. My article was even translated into Russian and posted on the local news site, Kloop Media.  Judson recovering in a hospital bed after having an appendectomy in Bishkek. This week, my old doctor shared with me the news that something indeed did happen as a result of my reporting. The son of a Kyrgyz parliamentarian read the article and showed it to his father, urging that these conditions were a shame and that the country should address them. After all, Kyrgyzstan certainly has the resources to do better. As the English idiom goes, “the squeaky wheel gets the grease,” and it would appear that my article was a pretty loud squeak. What I have now learned, is that this started a wave on which enough support was gained to make serious improvements to the country’s medical facilities. Just last month, a state of the art oncology center was opened in Bishkek. As for the surgical center where I received treatment, it has also seen a facelift. I was only dreaming that by sharing my experiences, I could make some impact at all on the Kyrgyz health care system. To learn that now a whole new hospital has been built on the support which my article played a part in forming is one of the most remarkable things I have ever come to know.  President Almazbek Atambayev of Kyrgyzstan breaks ground on a new medical facility. Photo credit: vb. kg Students attending university: A brilliant university student named Meerim once asked me to help her with a summer camp for students in the 15-16 year age range. The problem is that the students would be from an area of Kyrgyzstan which was off-limits for me to travel to. As a workaround solution, Meerim packed up all the students and brought them to me, in Bishkek. Roughly 20 students attended. For my part of the camp, we had two objectives: expose the students to basic computer skills, especially that of using Excel and understanding budgets, and also to expose them to universities in Bishkek. The hope was that we might inspire some of the students to consider applying for university when they finished their primary studies. The training was lots of fun and the kids grasped all of the concepts just fine.  They even seemed to find it all quite interesting. We toured a wide variety of universities ranging from the American university, a Russian university, a design university, and a technical college. We also exposed them to some local entrepreneurs, even gaining a tour of the roasting facility for Central Asia’s finest coffee roaster. After a week, the camp concluded and everyone went home, where I was never to see the students ever again. This week, I caught up with Meerim and she informed me that 100% of those students applied to, and are now attending, university! To top it off, they all got scholarships! This outcome was beyond anyone’s wildest hopes and is a testament to what impact anyone can make in the life of another person, especially if you reach them at a young age.  Judson provides computer training to students in Bishkek. Friends that are like family: Coming to Bishkek again felt like coming home. As I said earlier, Kyrgyzstan’s geographic beauty is vast, but that wouldn’t matter at all if it weren’t for the people who occupy the space. I adore them all. At every step, I came to realize that despite my scrappy, unkept, and often dirty appearance as an impoverished Peace Corps Volunteer, that never prevented me from forming relationships with wonderful people, or slowed me down in advancing the goals which I had set for myself. Kyrgyzstan empowered me to work hard and to strive for a common good. More importantly, the people worked with me to help me understand how I could be of service to them in a valuable way. This is my story, and so I tell it. But if the legacy is to persevere, it is not because it is mine, but because it is the collectives. None of this could have been done alone and I shy away from taking any amount of credit. I am proud to have been a part of these accomplishments, and I will continue to use my life to serve the community around me. I hope that you will do the same.  First time I departed from Bishkek vs the second time. Great friends all around! Posted by Judson Moore on Saturday, November 11, 2017 "

    "title": "How to spend a day in Denmark - A bike tour of Copenhagen",
    "body": "2017/10/19 - Biking my heritage in Copenhagen: Many moons ago, my family made the treacherous journey across the Atlantic Ocean to immigrate to the United States. What they left behind was a life in Denmark. Now, much to my surprise, and thanks to a company cruise I took with trivago, I find myself arriving at the shores of my forefathers. I only have a day to get to know this land, and I can’t think of a better way to do it than a bike tour of Copenhagen! #yeahbike! My bike tour group had 15 people in it and we were led by an awesome guide name Julia. It was clear from the start that Julia understands that she lives the dream. She just bikes all day and gets paid to meet people from all over the world. That is a pretty sweet gig if you ask me! Want to join me next year for trivago on Tour? See trivago’s open career opportunities. I will share some photos and history lessons learned while on the tour in the article below, and to help you follow along, here is a map of the route we rode. Statue of The Little Mermaid at Langelinie: Perhaps the most iconic statue in all of Denmark is this statue of The Little Mermaid based on the fairy tale by Dutch author Hans Christian Andersen. It is the same story which inspired Disney’s mermaid story, but here in the presence of the original mermaid, I learned that this mermaid never found her prince and instead was turned into seafoam. Rather tragic. So, some statue history: created in the early 1900s, the sculptor had a very difficult time finding a female model who would sit for the artist int he nude. It wasn’t considered very ladylike at the time. Eventually, a member of the national ballet came forward and volunteered to be the model, but with one caveat: the sculptor could not use her head. Now the mermaid had a body but was headless, and so the sculptor instead placed the head of his own wife upon the mermaid. In the years since, the mermaid has been decapitated and vandalized a number of times. Thanks to modern reinforced steel, the neck has been reinforced and it is believed that the vulnerability is no longer an issue. Let’s see. Also pictured here in the background is a building with a very pitched roof and white smoke coming out of it. This building totally fascinates me.  The Amager Bakke Waste Incinerator is Copenhagen’s new waste management facility. Its burn-off is so clean that it is surrounded by a city park and recreational area, and that pitched roof is a ski slope! It won’t open to the public until 2020, but I plan to get a ski pass as soon as I can and add it to the list of exotic places I have skied, like the time I skied in Dubai. The facility also features an 85-meter high observation desk with cafe deemed as the best view of Copenhagen, one of the world’s tallest climbing walls, and 10 hiking trails through landscaped forest.  Statens Museum For Kunst (artist museum): Though we didn’t get to go inside the National Gallery of Denmark, just passing by the back of the building was pretty impressive. These thick hedges next to the waterfront promenade made an impression. In fact, it wasn’t until after I got home and did some additional research that I came to know that this was a museum at all. Still, it called for being photographed and it a typical example of Dutch architecture along the waterfront of Copenhagen. Should I return to Copenhagen I will certainly take the time to pay a visit to the museum. The collection of nearly 9,000 paintings and sculptures, 240,000 works of art on paper, and 2,600+ plaster casts of figures from ancient times will be enough to keep me busy, especially if I find myself in Copenhagen on a rainy day.  The Queen’s Residence - Christian IX’s Palace: Unlike in England where you can’t get anywhere near the Queen’s residence, the Dutch queen has no closed gates, just a few ceremonial guards who will bark at you if you get too close. The building behind me is one of four nearly identical buildings which surround the courtyard in which I am standing. The only discernible thing about this building out of the other three is that it has five chimneys. The others have four. They say this chimney was added because of the current queen, Queen Marguerite, is a chain smoker. In fact, she has been requested to spend less time in the public eye because the Dutch, though they love her, would prefer it if their monarch was not seen smoking in public. Rather than ditch the habit, the queen just stays out of public view! The royal family is revered. This comes in part from their non-elitist lifestyle. If you stand among the palaces at the right time, it is highly likely that you can see the crown prince departing the palace taking his kids to and from school on a bicycle! And here is a fun linguist fact: in Dutch, the formal “you” is only used when addressing or referring to the Queen. At any other time, you use the casual “you” form. A stark difference from German! Frederik’s Church: The central cathedral of Copenhagen is also known as The Marble Church. The stones are, of course, marble, but more notably, the marble on the interior of the church is dark. The highlights against the marble come in the gold details and statue figures of white marble. The dome is the largest in Scandinavia and is fashioned after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.  The New Haven Canal: Copenhagen is webbed with canals. Similar to Amsterdam and other European coastal cities, Copenhagen’s canals define the city’s landscape. Here is one such canal, lined with shops, cafes, and houseboats. I imagine that the colorful buildings go a long way in sustaining the naturally cheerful mood of the Danes during the cold, wet, winters. You can see that even on this cloudy and grey day, this canal scene looks most welcoming! Freetown Christiania: The borough of Christianshavn is an anarchical district in Copenhagen which hasn’t had any influence from the Dutch laws for decades. The 1,000 or so inhabitants of the district maintain their own rules which are reflective of the American hippie movement of the 1960s and 1970s. However, because of the thriving cannabis trade in the area, the government has started to step in a bit in recent years and is working to negotiate the refederalization the neighborhood. For now, Christiania remains free and independent, but those days are likely numbered.  The Royal Library: The archives and royal library of Denmark have recently been moved into this beautiful and modern building. The library collection contains over 500 years of Danish literary works and other important relics. This is one of the largest libraries in the world and is the biggest in the entire Nordic region. This is Julia, our awesome tour guide.  Copenhagen from the Langebro Bridge: If you look at the map I provided at the beginning of this post, then you will see that this bride crossing is located that the southern-most point of our Copenhagen bike tour. This also means we have reached our halfway point in the tour. We took a short break and snapped some photos of the town behind us. The Copenhagen skyline, such as it is, is not dominated by towering buildings but rather with more historic buildings which maintain Copenhagen’s feeling of European authenticity.  Tivoli Gardens: Opening in 1843, Tivoli is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world. The oldest is also in Denmark just a few miles away, and is a staggering 250 years older, having opened in 1583! I guess the Danes have always known how to have a good time! Tivoli is a “seasonal park” in that it is only open during the warmer months of the year. Throughout all of Europe, Tivoli is the second most-visited such seasonal park. Though we just rode our bikes along the exterior wall and past the main entrance, pictured below, I easily got the impression that this is an impressive place. One other thing I learned is that millions of Danes have an annual membership to Tivoli Gardens and visit there with friends and family the same way New Yorkers might take a stole through Central Park. So the experience is presumably a bit more casual than Disneyland or King’s Island.  The small homes of Nyboder (old barracks): On the way back to our cruise ship, we passed by the old historic buildings of the colonial Danish Navy. The neighborhood now known as “Nyboder” is named as such for the hue of yellow which all of the buildings are painted. The original colors were red and white, like the Danish flag, but the new color makes a striking impression, and thus the name for the neighborhood. Today, Nyboder is mostly residential. The cute row homes look cozy and full of character. The cobblestone and brick streets offer a wonderful visual texture. The streets even have awesome names, such as “Unicorn Street. ” I couldn’t help but think to myself that if I lived in Copenhagen, I would want to live here.  Her Danish Majesty’s Yacht Dannebrog: This was a special treat! At the beginning of our bike tour, we passed within view of the royal yacht at port, but it was very far away and the photo didn’t really come out. Upon returning to my cabin on the cruise, I opened up my balcony and the HDMY Dannebrog was sitting directly outside of my window! This ship is the oldest royal-yacht in the world still in service. It was built just before WWII and is maintained by the Royal Navy. I watched the ship perform some maneuvers, more turning in a circle, really, and then it sailed away into the sunset and out into the open ocean. God rejse! (bon voyage in Danish) What a great day this was!: Well, I certainly wouldn’t have expected to see so much and learn so many interesting things from just a few hours in Copenhagen, but I really did. If ever you find yourself needing to make good use of just one day in Copenhagen, then I highly recommend taking a bike tour. Have you been to Copenhagen before?

    "title": "How to spend a day in Norway - Hiking in Baneheia Park in Kristiansand",
    "body": "2017/10/09 - I never thought I would spend 6-hours in Norway: Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Kristiansand, Norway for the first time thanks to a company trip I took with trivago. Not only was this my first time to Norway, but it was also the furthest north I had ever been. As excited as I was for this opportunity, there was one catch: we were on a cruise. This means that I had to figure out how to spend just 1 day in Norway. Luckily, there wasn’t much for me to figure out, as our organizers did all the heavy lifting. For anyone else who only gets to spend a day in Norway, you might have some problems figuring out how to best spend your time. So let me share with you what we did to spend a day in Norway. The welcoming committee of Kristiansand: We were welcomed with great fanfare to Kristiansand. There was a color guard displaying the Norwegian flag and other banners, as well as a band performing songs for us as we disembarked from our ship. They were all smiles and very friendly. Their traditional attire could only be described as “cute. ” It was lovely. We were also quite fortunate with the weather. The sky was blue and nearly cloudless. The temperature was crisp but warm in the sun. I also learned that the last weeks had seen mostly rain and we had arrived on the best day in recent memory, so we were very fortunate for that! The trivago Hike: it is an annual tradition: Today’s activity is a hike! The weather was perfect and considering everything was closed on this Sunday, hiking seems like the natural solution. Not to mention, taking in the nature is kind of a thing to do in Norway. We walked our way through the town center of Kristiansand, which was very quaint. The buildings are brightly painted and the harbor extends like a driveway all the way up to the storefronts. I imagine that such charm comes quite in hand during the long, dark winter. Want to join me next year for trivago on Tour? See trivago’s open career opportunities. The cafes and restaurants all had a 5-star appeal to them. I checked out some of the menus as we walked by and the prices didn’t seem at all out of the ordinary for any other place I have been to in Europe. This went at least a small way to shatter my expectation that Norway would make for a cost-prohibitive holiday in the future.  Into the woods: Baneheia Park: The Baneheia Park is today a beautiful park with tall evergreens and clear lakes. But this wasn’t always the case. By 1860, Baneheia was a source of national shame for Norwegians.  Baneheia even earned the nickname “the disgusting health. ” This reputation was caused by over-logging of the region which had turned Baneheia into an industrial wasteland. In 1862, a plan was set into motion to change this. The once-wasteland of Baneheia was landscaped into a beautiful park. Soldiers were sent in to plant as many as 150,000 trees until 1900. Dams were built to create lakes, paths were cleared with intent to ensure the park was accessible to people of all abilities, and even plumbing for toilets and drinking stations were put in. Further Reading: trivago on Tour: 2017 Cruise to Norway and Denmark The Baneheia Park today feels like as natural and clean a park as there ever was. Though any forest with paths and facilities instantly looses the “natural” feel of the great outdoors, this is as pleasant a place as any to experience the nature Norway is famous for and to take in some fresh Scandinavian air. For anyone who might like to follow in my footsteps, here is a map of where all we walked. Did I mention it was a beautiful day?: Again, the weather could not have been more perfect for us on this day. Here are just a few photos of my journey through the Baneheia Park and around Kristiansand. [gallery link=”file” size=”medium” ids=”18281,18288,18289,18291,18290,18292”] It was a great day: It was a great day and I am thankful to trivago for making it possible! Maybe you can join us next year! If you are interested to join me in 2018, just take a look at the open careers at trivago! If anything looks interesting to you, let me know and I will be happy to chat with you about a career in trivago. Have you ever been to Norway? Would you like to go there someday?

    "title": "What happened when I traveled alone in Beijing",
    "body": "2017/10/03 - Breaking Through the Fear of Travel: I sat on a bench just at the end of the thick stone bridge overlooking the icy, white Houhai Lake. The day was bright. Even brighter with the hazy sky against it. The iced lake looked like a thick layer of clouds and I was at the edge of a cliff. Just to the left of me was a line of trees hugging the edge I imagined I was on. The famous Marble Boat of Beijing’s Summer Palace was docked just near the edge of the bridge, anchored in by the thick ice. Just a year before, I added this place, this moment, to a long list of things I wanted to see during my Peace Corps service in China. A year before, I didn’t realize I would be traveling solo in China, let alone making this trip and seeing this place for the first time, and I would be doing it solo. Sitting on that bench, looking at the Marble Boat on the ice lake in February, I felt invincible, like I could travel anywhere. I wondered why I had been so scared of this feeling and convinced myself for so long that I couldn’t see the places I wanted to. On that bench, I wrote in my journal for several minutes to take it all in.  “It’s so easy to keep exploring and going to the places you’ve only dreamt of seeing. After the first initial time making the decision to adventure, each time after is a no brainer. You just do it. No questions. No doubts. It’s so easy after you stop talking about it and instead go do it. ”-February, 2nd, 2015 Seeing the Marble Boat at the Summer Palace: Just a few days before that moment I took sitting beside the Marble Boat, I arrived in Beijing. I had a lump in my throat, nauseous at the idea of traveling by myself. I wanted the comfort of someone beside me; anyone. I had never traveled alone before. I had always traveled to destinations where someone was waiting on the other end. I was traveling alone and there is something so frightening and yet so freeing about that feeling. I had zero cell service since my SIM card only worked in my home province. I navigated my way to the hostel I was staying in, struggling to communicate with cab drivers and locals using the six months of Mandarin I had in my language arsenal. I reached my hostel very late that night. It was tucked in what seemed like the darkest of Hutong Alleys. I signed in at the front desk, peering around the dimly lit common area. I remember thinking it looked like I had walked into a really bad part of town. But in the daylight, the décor was a variety of mismatched tapestries, pillows, blankets, bookcases full of books, and an enormous skylight to let the day in. The woman set me up with my room and told me where to go. When I entered the hostel, all the beds were occupied by sleeping women. I did my best to be quiet, undressing in the dark, adding extra socks, sweaters, and pants to stay warm and climbed into the top bunk. I fell asleep immediately. The next day would be my first full day in Beijing.  The Great Wall of China, Badaling, South Wall in Beijing: The next day I spent navigating around the gargantuan metropolis of Beijing. For 6 months, I lived and served in Chongqing City, located in the southern part of China. Chongqing City’s population is 11 million, a number I couldn’t even fathom. But Beijing one-upped Chongqing in size. I couldn’t even comprehend the mass of the city or the area of land it covered. My first trip of that day was to the Great Wall of China (of course), the Badaling South wall at the 4th Tower. I purchased my ticket at Beijing North Railway station, hopped aboard the train, and traveled two hours to the see the Great Wall. Once I stepped off, I followed the masses to the wall of stone that many in this world don’t get to see. I stopped before it and just stared. Sure, it was the Great Wall. What’s the big deal? Lots of people have seen it. It’s a tourist attraction. But to me, it was more than that. It was the realization that everything I had manifested about travel as a child was finally coming to be. I continued to the stone steps that would lead me up onto the wall and then headed south. The south part of the wall was steep, too steep for the average Chinese women in dresses and heels, although you would be surprised. I walked up for as far as I could, peering over the walls at the dead land covered by a winter chill. I was sure this place looked incredible in the summer months when the land was lush. I stood on that wall, for as a long as I could, touching the stone to keep the memory real. When I felt my lingering was overdone, I walked back down to the entrance toward the train that would take me back into the city. Additional Reading: Solo Female Travel Advice The Train Ride Back to Beijing: I bought my return ticket and waited in the terminal for the next train, silently eating snacks I brought with me. Moments later, a group of soft-spoken and thin young men with bowl cuts approached me. They rattled off Chinese to me at a rate I couldn’t comprehend. I replied in Chinese with one of the words I knew, “What?” One of the young men paused for a moment and then spoke in English. It was broken, but I got the message. “My friends took picture of you?” He said. I smiled and said yes. The young man sat down next to me so his friends could take the picture. They told me ‘thank you’ and returned to their seats in the terminal. When it was time to line up and board the train, the young man approached me with slight hesitation once again. When I caught his eye, he moved closer and without saying a word presented me with a small gift. It was a carved wooden doll that resembled a nesting doll. It’s smiling face and body was hand painted with greens, reds, and blacks. There was a red thread loop attached at the top and a red tassel attached at the bottom. I declined this gift (a polite gesture to show gratitude) and he insisted I keep it. His cheeks were a bright red as I accepted the gift and told him ‘thank you. ’ It was quite possibly the only thing this boy had to give me. And while it may not have been worth much when he bought it, it was worth a fortune to me. It was moments like this that brought me to China in the first place. I wanted to see places, experience the world, connect with people and make a lasting impact on at least one person. Down the road, I would impact many.  Communicating Love and Gratitude: Communicating gratitude and love without words was one of the greatest things I learned. And it was that solo trip that led me to the addiction of solo travel and my desire to meet people, see the greatness of it, and discover more of myself. After Beijing, there wasn’t a place in the country I was afraid to travel to. I’ve been home from Peace Corps for over a year and my track record of brave travel has taken me to places I never imagined, like impromptu trips to Bangkok, Thailand where I met and danced with New Yorkers traveling through Asia. I finally got to eat authentic Pad Thai, which is very similar to how my mother cooks it. I recently traveled alone to Page, Arizona for a solo camping trip and kayaking tour in Antelope Canyon. Even there I had no cell service, which led to a laughable moment of me reminiscing about my past. People thought I was crazy, for traveling alone. They say they could never go without having someone with them. Others applaud me for having the bravery to solo travel. It’s freeing, meditative, and it’s a good way to know yourself and see what you’re made of. What I learned from solo travel, was that I could be quiet enough with myself and take moments to understand who I was and what path I wanted to take next. My bravery to solo travel was there within me, but it never truly came out until I faced my incredibly solo life as Peace Corps Volunteer in China, which was terrifying. All the more reason to do it. And it was from that that I vowed to encourage people to do the same and connect with their true selves. What Happens If You Solo Travel?: So what if you solo travel? What if you get to see the Great Wall, dance at Khao San Road, or kayak through red marbled canyons? What if you run into strangers and worldly friendships? What if you find the strength of who you are? What if you discover your true passion and happiness in this world? Solo travel. It will be good for you. "

    "title": "5 Reasons Why Giving Thanks is Good For You",
    "body": "2017/09/30 - Why should we give thanks?: There are all sorts of reasons why we should all work at giving thanks. Ranging from health benefits, feeling good, and changing the world, expressions of gratitude go a long way in helping us live more fulfilling and positive lives. Personally, I find that giving thanks is something to be worked at. I am very grateful for many things. But if I am being honest, I don’t express my gratitude to others nearly as often as I should. I don’t even express gratitude out loud to others even when it is what I am thinking in my mind. This is an area in which I know I can become better, and I bet I am not alone. Let me start with this: I am grateful for you.   That felt great! And now, what benefits can we expect to achieve by giving thanks? Here is a list of some of the best benefits of gratitude. #1 - Giving thanks is good for your heart: According to a University of California San Diego School of Medicine study, giving thanks helps ward off heart decease. By giving thanks, your mind releases stress, reduces anxiety and is less susceptible to depression. This one-two punch of positivity not only feels good to you and others, but research shows that expressions of gratitude can prolong your life. #2 - Giving thanks makes the world a better place: Regardless of if you live longer or not, wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world full of gratitude rather than one void of it? I imagine that such a world would be a magical place where anything is possible. Here is a video which has a similar meaning and which is sure to brighten your day :) #3 - Giving thanks is better than not: Not only would the world be more dull and depressing if there were no expressions of gratitude, people who don’t give thanks are more likely to be complainers and to see things more negatively. We have all said, “I would be happy if…” That blank can be filled-in with “I had the new iPhone,” “I were a bit older/younger,” “I knew then what I knew today,” so on and so forth. The fact of the matter is that we people are always striving for the next rung on the ladder. That is not a bad thing. That is what drives us forward and keeps us fighting for a better tomorrow. However, looking toward tomorrow should not distract from your good fortunes of today.  When was the last time you said “I would be happy if…” and then you actually were happy when you obtained the thing? And was that a thing or an experience? I argue that lifelong happiness is made by experiences, and no matter what we strive to accomplish tomorrow, we should be grateful for what we have today. Further reading: The Secret To All My Success #4 - Giving thanks increases peoples’ trust in you: According to one research paper from the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, people who express gratitude are perceived as more trustworthy by others. Wouldn’t you like for people to trust you more than they already do? Become more conscious in your expressions of gratitude and enjoy the benefits of others holding you in higher esteem.  The Thanks Wall at Mutual Mobile. #5 - Giving thanks feels good: Imagine telling someone that you are thankful for them or for something they did. What would their response be? Would they frown at you and shrug their shoulders? Or would they smile, say “thank you” and possibly give you a hug? When we give thanks to others, we create joy which is shared by all involved, especially you. A challenge for giving thanks: I bet you already have tons to be thankful for. But I also bet you haven’t thought about gratitude in a conscious way for a while. So how about now? I challenge you to write 100 things that you are thankful for. If you use this list as a guide, I am confident you will quickly discover that 100 is far too short of a list! Write a list of…    10 living people you are grateful for.     10 people who have died you are grateful for.     10 physical abilities you are grateful for.     10 material possessions you are grateful for.     10 things about nature you are grateful for.     10 things about today you are grateful for.     10 places on earth you are grateful for.     10 modern-day inventions you are  grateful for.     10 foods you are grateful for.     10 things about your community you are grateful for.  So how did it go? How do you feel now? Can you turn this list into action by telling anyone, or even things on this list that you are thankful for them? Try it. Tell that friend how thankful you are. Tell your phone how thankful you are. And if you are really adventurous, leave a comment below to let the world know something you are thankful for! "

    "title": "trivago On Tour - Cruise 2017 to Norway and Denmark",
    "body": "2017/09/21 - The opinions expressed in this article are my own and not the views of my employer. trivago on Tour: The Pinnacle of Office Culture: I have had the good fortune to work at one of Europe’s best companies for employee satisfaction: trivago. The hotel metasearch, known worldwide for its guerilla television marketing tactics and services for helping travelers find their ideal hotel at the best available rate, is a German-based company with an amazing workplace culture. The cultural highlight of the year for trivago employees is trivago on Tour. Read more: How metasearch saves me loads of time and money trivago on Tour is an annual trip for all trivago employees. The activities and destination are closely guarded secrets, leaving employees with only rumors, hearsay, and dreaming of where the trip might take them until we are already there. My first trivago on Tour was in 2016 when we chartered a fleet of jets to fly us to the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. Now in 2017, our destination turned out to be a Nordic cruise to Norway and to Denmark. Before I dig into what we did this year during trivago on Tour, let me address the question I always get: why does trivago do this? Well, I think there are a few reasons trivago invests in this tour experience, but the more obvious one is to foster personal relationships among employees. Everything about the trip, from our roommate assignment, group activities, and seat buddies on the train are assigned at random. This random assignment ensures that we are exposed to people that we may otherwise never meet as the company rapidly grows. Fostering relationships between employees has great value in the longterm development of the company, even if it is not always an obvious pairing in the beginning. Kudos to you trivago for making this kind of social investment in your people. Want to join me next year for trivago on Tour? See trivago’s open career opportunities. No sleep for the wicked: We started out for this year’s trivago on Tour at 3:00 am from the Düsseldorf main train station. Our private train was a Deutsche Bahn classic which looked like it hadn’t seen service for awhile, but I was exhausted enough to put my head down and sleep for most of the 7-hour journey. There were two trains, each with about a dozen train cars. I was in a normal train car but later learned some people had the good fortune of sleeper cars. Maybe next year! We had food catered to our seats for the journey and there was also a dining car, but I never made it down there. At the end of the ride, I learned that there had also been a party car, but I had no energy for that. As you will read later, I made up for this on the way home. One note here on the random seat assignments. The train car I was in had no beds, so it was easily one of the less comfortable options of the train, and yet seated across from me was out founder and CEO, Rolf Schrömgens. Our random assignments make no exceptions, even for those who you would think might be able to influence their way into greater comfort. There are many examples of this kind of non-elitism demonstrated by the trivago leadership, but I thought that in this particularly uncomfortable, long, middle of the night, train ride, the founder might opt-in to a little better sleep. So good on you Rolf. Good on you.  It’s a cruise! Our activity revealed. : For the next four days, we will call the AIDAmar cruise ship home! This modern palace of a ship sails all around the world and is a gem of the AIDA fleet. As is the tradition for trivago on Tour, this boat is our private home; no one else will be on this cruise with us. Despite all of trivago being present, we only fill the ship to about half capacity, and due to great planning by our events team, at no moment will we feel like the crowd is thin. This was my first cruise and I had no idea what to expect. The security is far more extensive than at the airport, even asking health-related questions about recent illness. I had to turn over my passport and residency card, which didn’t please me that much as it came as a surprise, but I went along with the protocol without argument. Once I passed through all of that, there was a glass of champaign awaiting me, which I drank as I listened to a band perform on my way to boarding the ship. We were paired up with a roommate for the journey, but mine didn’t show up. On one side, I very much enjoyed having a cabin to myself, especially since I arrived exhausted and instantly needed to take a nap for a few hours. But there is a lot to be said for the energy you get from having a roommate while on tour, so if I had it to do over again in the way of my own choosing, I would probably stick to having the roommate present. Once I recovered from my long journey I got up and showered. I was certain that the boat was still at the port as there was zero detectable movement. So when I threw back the curtains and saw the sea speeding by my balcony with no land in sight, I was quite surprised! The AIDAmar has everything. An indoor concert hall and theater, a rooftop pool deck with concert amphitheater, plenty of bars and restaurants, a casino, duty-free shopping, a spa, game rooms, lounges, a disco, and the list goes on and on. Of course, the venue being great is one thing, but what really makes it special are the people. The crew was super amazing and always going the extra mile for us. My trivago colleagues were, of course, a pleasure to hang out with, as always, and the onboard entertainment we would experience while we cruised around the Nordics was world-class.  Mando Diao makes a surprise concert: Just because we now know that we will be taking a cruise for trivago on Tour, that does not mean that all the secrets are revealed. We do not know exactly where the cruise is headed and we do not know what surprises might be awaiting us. On our first night, we headed to the rooftop pool deck and amphitheater for a special surprise after dinner. We arrived to find that an unnamed band was set up to perform. Being a musician myself with a background in concert production, I could quickly tell that this was a well-funded show and would likely have the talent to match. As the clock struck 10:00 pm, a stagehand walked out and pulled the backdrop into position to reveal that the band to perform was the Swedish rock band, Mando Diao. The crowd went crazy. A minute later, the intro music started up and the band took to the stage. I was front and center for the show and got an amazing video of their first song. Here is Mando Diao performing Down in the Past as their opening song for trivago on Tour 2017: Hiking in Norway with perfect weather: On day one I woke up to find that the ship is still sailing. I check my GPS and see that we have passed Oslo. Oslo was everyone’s top guess for where we were headed so this did come as a surprise. I made myself ready for the day and got some breakfast, then went to the upper deck to take a look around. Before long, we came to the quaint port of Kristiansand, Norway. Kristiansand is a small town which I learned from a local is known for being “the sunniest city in Norway. ” As we got off of the boat we were greeted by a delegation of traditionally-dressed Norwegian flag bearers, and a moose. The weather was perfect for being outside, which was great because we were going for a hike! Our hike wound us through about 5 miles of pristine nature in the Baneheia Park. This park was constructed starting in 1860 and is well planned-out with lakes, trails, dining and toilet facilities. In fact, the park has so many great things to say about it, that I wrote a whole post about how to spend a day in Norway! Further reading: How to spend a day in Norway: Hiking in Baneheia Park in Kristiansand A post shared by Judson L Moore (@judsonlmoore) on Sep 17, 2017 at 11:10am PDT A bicycle tour of Copenhagen: On day two of trivago on Tour, we arrived in Copenhagen! This was of particular excitement to me, because my ancestors came to America from Denmark. We were given the choice of several activities, including a beer tasting, a street food festival, a fast boat ride, and a bike ride. I opted-in for the Copenhagen bike ride! The 8-mile bike ride through the capital of Denmark was met again with perfect weather! We visited the queen’s residence, the royal boatyard, Christianshavn, the royal library, meatpacking district, and the world’s second-oldest amusement park: Tivoli. Fun fact: in the Danish language, the only time that the formal “you” is used is when addressing or referring to the queen. To all other people, the informal “you” is used. Further reading: How to spend a day in Denmark: A bike tour of Copenhagen The party lasts until the last possible second: Despite the all-day physical activities and the all-night parties during trivago on Tour, we somehow found the energy to party the entire way back to Düsseldorf on our 7-hour train journey after the cruise ended. Remember the party train I slept through at the beginning of this voyage? Well, I made up for it on the way home. From start to finish, I partied like crazy for the duration of the whole train ride. Words can not describe how insane this was. So let me show you in this video: Exhausted. Happy. : What do you think? Could you handle trivago on Tour? Maybe you can join next year!

    "body": "2017/07/18 - Aniko Villalba is an Argentinean-Hungarian author and true citizen of the world. She has spent the last decade traveling the world and sharing her experiences as the author of three books and the Viajando Por Ahi Blog. I had an opportunity to meet Aniko in Düsseldorf, Germany, where she gave a presentation at trivago about her life and career as a digital nomad. After the presentation, I was invited to join her and a small group to dinner. We got to talking and I became deeply captivated by the rest of her story and candor. In a world full of dreamers, she fits right in, but she is not afraid to tell it like it is and shed a light on the often-neglected harshness of life. Aniko did me the honor of agreeing to an interview with me. The following text is that interview. What was the moment when everything changed? When you went from being who you were before, to being the global traveler that you are today?: Aniko Villalba - **I don’t know when that happened… Maybe when I was lost somewhere in China! I think everything changed when I published my first book, in 2013, and people started physically sharing my stories. I’ve heard many times: “I gave your book as a present to someone who wanted to travel”, or “I exchanged your book at a hostel” or “I saw someone reading your book on the subway this morning”… Once I even met by chance a girl in the airport bus in Barcelona who was reading my book! These things astonish me, I feel they are reading someone else, not me! But my books are everything to me and it makes me happy to know that they **inspire others to follow their dreams. What does “slow travel” mean to you, and why is it your preferred pace of travel?: Aniko Villalba - **For me slow travel is not really about the speed of the trip, it’s more about how you look at a place, how you relate to it, what things you choose to do (and not to do) there. I like to compare it to a visit to a museum: if you go inside a big famous museum (let’s say the Louvre) you will probably feel the urge to see “everything”, to go from room to room, to see each and every painting and, of course, to take a picture of the Mona Lisa (because how could you not do it?). But what if instead of trying to see everything you just focus your time on enjoying three or four of your favorite paintings? Or maybe even just one. That’s slow travel for me: the urge to do all kinds of stuff and the fear of missing out will always be there, but I prefer to just see and do what really interests me, **even if it means going to Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower, or if it means staying one month in the same location.  To other would-be travelers out there, what advice do you give for how to get started?: Aniko Villalba - **I think there’s never an ideal time to start, especially if your dream is to be a long-term traveler or a digital nomad, you will never have the time or the money you think you need (even less, both at the same time), so **you just have to start. Take a small step and do it. In my case, I bought a one-way bus ticket from Buenos Aires to Bolivia and that’s how I started. I had no idea how I was going to finance my trips, where I would sleep during the following months and what places I would visit. But once you start, things slowly fall into place. So I would say: don’t try to have everything solved before you leave. It’s impossible and it will be an excuse to never leave your home. Additional reading: Why Travel While Young? You describe yourself as an introvert. Does that make traveling the world more difficult, or make you more observant and appreciative of your experiences?: Aniko Villalba - **I like to say that everyone should travel as their personality tells them to. **There is no “ideal traveler personality. ” In my case, travel has helped me to be a lot more open to strangers, to ask for help when I need it, to trust people I don’t know and to listen to my guts. Maybe being an introvert makes me more observant, and it also makes me enjoy solo travel a lot. However, I also love to meet new people and be social, but I just need to disconnect and wind down once in awhile, maybe for a longer time than other people. I love to spend time journaling, wandering, and sitting in public spaces by myself, watching the life around me.  A post shared by Aniko Villalba (@anikovillalba) on Dec 30, 2016 at 9:31am PST Being independent does not mean going it alone. Who most influenced you in your pursuit of traveling the world? How?: Aniko Villalba - When I started dreaming about traveling the world, there were almost no travel blogs (or at least I didn’t find them in 2007) or “real people” that I could relate to. So the ones who influenced me were some well-known travel writers and photographers, such as Paul Theroux, Martín Caparros (an Argentinian writer) and Steve McCurry. I was lucky enough to interview McCurry for a magazine I was working at the time and it was very inspiring to meet the person who took some of the most beautiful pictures I had ever seen. I will always remember what he said when I asked him how he was able to take such natural and intimate pictures of the people in Asia: “People just invite me into their homes. You will see. ” And he was right. Additional Reading: Relationships - A Nomad’s Philosophy I have thought a lot about what “empowerment” is and have come to believe it is a combination of three things: ability, permission, and desire. Do you agree or disagree? And how have your experiences shaped this view?: Aniko Villalba - **I agree, and as I said when we met, I think that to be empowered you need to be conscious of the power that you have. When I traveled to Iceland with one of my best friends we decided to play a game of challenges, and one of the missions we had was to go all around the island by hitchhiking. So we stood by the side of the road, we extended our thumbs and five minutes later we had three cars waiting in line to take us. After 20 days of being picked up with only a few seconds of wait, we felt super powerful, because we knew **we could get anywhere we wanted only by asking the people to take us.  A post shared by Aniko Villalba (@anikovillalba) on Mar 15, 2017 at 4:08pm PDT What obstacles have you faced as a solo woman traveler around the world? How have you overcome them?: Aniko Villalba - As a solo traveler I’ve had a lot more positive than negative experiences while traveling. People usually think it’s the opposite, they get scared when I say I will travel alone somewhere, but for me, it’s always been very rewarding. I’ve been able to meet a lot of women around the world (women who, when they saw me traveling with a man didn’t come close to us, and when they saw me alone immediately wanted to chat with me about my life and my country). I think the main disadvantage I see is that sometimes I stop from doing everything I’d like to do or from going anywhere I’d like to go. Other than that, I’ve always been treated with respect. Your second book, El síndrome de París (The Paris Syndrome), focused on the harsh realities of living a nomadic lifestyle. What have those realities taught you about yourself?: Aniko Villalba - That I don’t want to live as a nomad forever. A few days ago I wrote a blog post titled “I’m tired of traveling” (Spanish) in which I opened up to my readers and told them that I don’t want to travel anymore (at least for now) and that my dream right now is to find a house in France and settle down here with my husband. I want to have my own space, my desk, my bookshelf, a group of friends, daily activities and routines. I think that traveling became so much a part of my routine that I stopped enjoying it as before. So, for now, I decided it’s best to stop and focus on my writing, on my future online courses and on other creative projects that I have going on. And when I feel like it, I will travel again.  What does “home” mean to you?: Aniko Villalba - It’s a hard one. This is the question I’ve been asking myself for a few years now. Before I thought “home” was the place where I was born, but now I think home is the place where I feel good and where I’m near the people I love. For the next few years, I think I will have two homes: France and Argentina. By now, you must be well-acquainted with the human condition. What about humanity gives you the most hope for the future?: Aniko Villalba - That everywhere I go, people are hospitable and kind. Everyone is just trying to live as happily as possible, in spite of the particular situation of each country, people just want to be happy. The bad news is a very small part of what really goes on in the world. Thank you, Aniko!: It was such an honor for me to get to know Aniko and for her to do this interview with me. I hope that all you readers out there have enjoyed getting to know her a little bit as well! Please leave Aniko and me a comment below with your thoughts, inspirations, and personal story.

    "title": "In the south of Brazil, find Germany in the town of Blumenau",
    "body": "2017/07/12 - Far from Germany, Blumenau is all Deutsch: In the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina is a city called Blumenau, which is as German as any city in Germany (and I know, I live in Germany!) From the cobblestone streets, to the post-and-beam architecture, and the bakeries on every corner, you wouldn’t know you are not in Germany if you just woke up here one day. A buddy of mine, Leo, who I was visiting in Florianópolis, had a family apartment in Blumenau, so we decided to go spend a few days there. He and I met while we were both Rotary Youth Exchange students in Germany, so getting to experience the German culture together again was quite special. This post was written with support from Embratur, which is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism and which operates VisitBrasil. com. They have supplied me with images and marketing support. All views expressed are solely my own and based on my personal experiences and independent research. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Beautiful architecture, rolling hills, immediate access to nature, riverfront access, local breweries, local vineyards, and lots of festivals and special events. Lowlights - If you are visiting Brazil for a limited time, you might consider experiencing more “real” Brazilian destinations, rather than this Europeanized town. Bottom line - The year-round temperate climate make Blumenau an ideal destination at anytime. As the Brazilian capital of beer and wine, along with many event facilities, you will always find something special going on in Blumenau.  The Blumenau Oktoberfest | Photo by: Vitor Pamplona. Party like a German in Brazil: Oktoberfest in Blumenau: The Blumenau Oktoberfest is the biggest Oktoberfest celebration in the world outside of Munich. It has been operating for only three decades, yet it draws people from all over the world to celebrate Bavarian-style in Blumenau. Despite all the similarities between the Oktoberfest celebrations in Germany and Blumenau, the one missing element, ironically, is German beer! The +500,000 liters of beer consumed during the 2-week Blumenau Oktoberfest is primarily brewed by local craft beer brewer, Eisenbahn. Eisenbahn does brew to the strict German Purity Law, proclaimed by Duke William IV of Bavaria in 1516, which states that a beverage can only be called “beer” when it is made from 3 ingredients: water, barley and hops. All in all, the Blumenau Oktoberfest is both in a class of its own, and as near to a mirror-image as you can find of the Munich Oktoberfest. If you are planning a trip to Brazil in October, be sure to make time to get down south and give Blumenau a twirl! Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil, Street Scene. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Blumenau: A city split by a river: Blumenau is divided in two by the Itajaí-Açu River. The city center runs along the waterfront, which is vibrant with life, walking trails, and beautiful views. Most people live outside of the downtown area, up on the nearby hillsides. The Itajaí-Açu River has a bad history of catastrophic flooding, and though there are more modern systems in place today to tame the river, the terrible floods of the early 1980s are too fresh in peoples’ minds, so they stick to higher ground. On most days, though, the riverfront is a great place to walk, have a drink, and enjoy the view and fresh mountain air. The hilly region around Blumenau is also ideal for vineyards, and thusly there are many. Pinot Noir is the wine of choice in Blumenau, so get a glass, find a place to relax, and enjoy life in Blumenau! By Marlon Hammes de Blumenau, Brasil. - Blumenau, CC BY 2. 0, Link Even with more than 300,000 inhabitants, Blumenau feels like a pretty small town. While visiting here, you will find many modern amenities and great shopping. The standard of living is among the highest in all of Brazil, so all the comforts of life will be available to you as a visitor. So take a walk, take a breather, enjoy a glass of wine or beer fresh from Blumenau, and enjoy the city’s interesting streets, architecture, and numerous statues which hail from the city founders’ European heritage.  Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil, Golden Statue. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Learn about what you are drinking: The Blumenau Museu da Cerveja is all about beer. With all of the German influence in Blumenau and the multitude of local craft beer breweries, this makes the Museu da Cerveja a prime place to learn about the beer brewing process. The museum is quite small and you can honestly get through the whole thing in under half an hour. The Museu da Cerveja will walk you through the entire history of beer from prehistoric times up until today. You will of course learn about how beer is brewed and you will have an opportunity to get answers to any questions you may have about the general process, the local beer culture, or just what is going on in town tonight. Pro Tip: The museum is free and the bathrooms are really clean.  Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil, Museu da Cerveja. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank.

    "title": "Beach, innovation, and majestic views. Welcome to Florianopolis, Brazil.",
    "body": "2017/07/06 - An island of the land: Florianopolis has received accolades from The New York Times, Newsweek and others ranging from marking the city as the party destination of the year to being in the top ten most dynamic cities worldwide. I was visiting a friend in Florianopolis who I got to know while in Germany as a Rotary Youth Exchange student. His family lived on the beach-facing side of the island, so I really got to experience the beach life of Florianopolis more than anything else. Though I am starting to feel a bit repetitive in my describing of Brazilian beaches, like that of Porto Seguro in the north of Brazil, this beach has a totally different vibe. Now that we are further away from the equator, the waters are not nearly as warm, but the waves are great, making Florianopolis one of the top surfing destinations in Brazil. The city of Florianopolis is also a rather sizable and modern city, with more modern attractions than historical sites, despite its 500-year history. This post was written with support from Embratur, which is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism and which operates VisitBrasil. com. They have supplied me with images and marketing support. All views expressed are solely my own and based on my personal experiences and independent research. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Pristine beaches, dynamic topography, great surfing, reliable waves, modern city. Lowlights - Colder water, a little pricier than other Brazilian cities, unreliable and slow public transit. Bottom line - If you are in the south of Brazil, then you must visit Florianopolis. The city has something for every person and offers an experience very different from any other Brazilian city. If you are a surfer or avid beachgoer: welcome to paradise. Orienting yourself around Florianopolis: Florianopolis is a large island city off the southern coast of Brazil. It is the capital of the state of Santa Catarina, where I also visited the Germanesque town of Blumenau. The 33-mile-long island is truly a land of two tales. The ocean-facing side of the island is all about the beach, whereas the land-facing side of the island is a bit more serious about the business and politics of running one of Brazil’s highest standard of living states. The city does extend into the mainland as well, where around 1 million people live in the metropolitan area. Though the city is vibrant with nightclubs, cuisine, and many annual events, perhaps the biggest draw to Florianopolis, and the one which I will focus on in this post is the beaches. The beaches of Florianopolis: There are a total of 42 beaches in Florianopolis. The best known are:    North          Canasvieiras           Brava Beach           Jurerê (and Jurerê Internacional)           InglesesBeach           Ponta das Canas          East          MoleBeach           Galheta Beach (nudist beach)           Barra da Lagoa           Joaquina Beach           Brava Beach          South          Campeche           Armação           Matadeiro           Pântano do Sul           Solidão           Saquinho       I was situated in the eastern (central) area of Florianopolis, so these are the beaches I can speak to best. In particular, Mole Beach and Joaquina Beach Pro tip: The northern beaches are the most popular, and have the most activities and amenities, however, the southern stretch of the Florianopolis island is less inhabited and the beaches there will be much less crowded. If you go that way, be prepared with a picnic and anything else you might need to be comfortable for the day, as there might be fewer vendors to sell you such things.  Florianopolis, Santa Catarina Brazil, Joaquina Beach. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Joaquina Beach: The Joaquina Beach is located on the eastern side of the Florianopolis island. This beach has the best surfing in the area, and as such, is the most popular destination for younger visitors. I cannot catch a wave to save my life, as you can see in the video posted in my guide about Porto Seguro, but I love people-watching and admiring others who can do all the water sports way better than I can. I acquainted myself more with a beach towel and long walks during the sunrise and sunset. I can say that in the mornings, the Joaquina Beach is more or less empty. Depending on the day, the beach can get pretty full by 10:00 A. M. or noon. All of the to-be-expected beach activities can be found at Joaquina Beach. You should note that this is one of the top surfing destinations in Brazil, and known worldwide for its reliable waves. This means that as a swimmer, you will be sharing space with surfers, so just be mindful of that.  Florianopolis, Santa Catarina Brazil, Joaquina Beach Sandboard. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. The other super cool activity at Joaquina Beach, which I did not expect to find, is sandboarding! The dunes of Joaquina Beach are really impressive and are perfect for strapping a board to your feet and letting gravity do all the work. At the time and location when I was there, there were no lifts, so you have to walk up the dunes yourself, which isn’t a bad thing due to distance, as much as it is just difficult to walk up a hill of sand. Here is a great video I found with a short driving tour around Florianopolis, and then showing off the beaches and the sandboarding as well. Mole Beach: Like other eastern / central beaches Florianopolis, Mole is also all about the surfing. In fact, this beach is nearly exclusively about the surfing. The terrain here is a bit less sandy, so no sandboarding, but there are several scuba expeditions which depart from Mole. The surrounding view is really beautiful with green hills and large rock formations. I find that the aesthetic of Mole Beach is much more interesting than the more typical sandy beaches.  Florianopolis, Santa Catarina Brazil, Mole Beach. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Traveling between the mainland and the beaches: I usually stick to public transportation when I travel, but this is one bus ride you might want to skip. Depending on the route, the trip from the continental side of Florianopolis to any of the island beaches can easily take more than an hour, and up to 2. 5 hours. You can not avoid making transfers, and since the island and the mainland are connected by only 3 bridges (of which, the main one pictured below, is closed for renovation as of this writing), makes traffic congestion a problem. Visiting both sides of Florianopolis is well worth it, just be aware of this. Uber now operates in Florianopolis, and for just USD$10-15 each way, you can cut down the drive time from the continental downtown to Mole Beach to about 35 minutes. Taking all of that in mind, Florianopolis is a big place, so you might like to align your accommodations with the area that you want to focus your time in. That, or switch accommodations after a few days so that you can experience both the island side and the continental side of Florianopolis with greater ease.

    "body": "2017/06/30 - Imagine yourself going on an adventure in the Amazon Forest or in the Pantanal, being amazed by the beauty of the nature in Foz do Iguaçu or Bonito, living the culture of São Luís or Ouro Preto, trying the hustle and bustle of great centers such as Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, or simply relaxing and enjoying the sun and the breeze of the ocean in Fernando de Noronha or Trancoso. This is what you can discover when you visit Brazil. Brazil is a continental country: Its 3. 3 million square miles make up almost half of South America. Containing six biomes, the country holds the largest biodiversity on the planet, not to mention the 4,500 mile-long coastline with paradise beaches and attractions for all tastes. It is also a young country marked by a mixture of cultures originating from Portuguese colonizers and a native indigenous population, Africans brought over during the colonial period, and Europeans and Asians who arrived at the beginning of the 20th Century. Many traditions and artistic manifestations, such as the famous Brazilian Carnival, which has different characteristics all over the country, have emerged from this cultural melting pot. In fact, Brazil offers infinite possibilities to the traveler. Going there may be simpler than many Americans imagine. Even so, some tips may come in handy before one makes the decision to pack his or her bags and head south.  Sao Pedro Church in Gramado, Brazil | Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. The best time of the year to visit Brazil: Brazil is a tropical country, with high average temperatures and plenty of rain throughout the year. Due to its huge size, however, its regions show strong climatic differences. During the summer, from December to March, thermometers will normally stay above 75° F in most of the country, and might even reach 104 ° F in some places. December, January, and February are great months to visit busier coastal destinations, such as Maceió, Porto Seguro, Búzios, and Balneário Camburiú. During Brazilian winter, nevertheless, between June and September, average temperatures will drop drastically and even go below 32° F in some cities in the south of the country. It’s a great moment to get to know the mountain regions of the south and southeast, such as Campos do Jordão, Petrópolis, Gramado, and Canela; or to head to the mountain ranges known as Chapadas (Diamantina, dos Veadeiros, das Mesas, Jalapão, among others), which have lush vegetation and abundant waterfalls after the rainy season. Visit my full Brazilian Travel Guide The fall, between March and June, and spring, between September and December, are low seasons in Brazil and, therefore, the perfect moment to enjoy lower prices and escape tourist-filled hotels and attractions. Besides, temperatures are milder, with sunny days and pleasant nights in most of the country. However, because it is such a huge country, it is hard to indicate the best time to visit Brazil. Whichever period you choose, if you want to fully enjoy your experience in each destination, it is a good idea to do a little research and plan beforehand.  Beach of Buzios, Brazil | Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. The Tourist Visa: Brazil’s visa policy is based on the principle of reciprocity. This means that citizens from countries that require entry visas from Brazilians into their own countries will also need a visa in order to travel to Brazil. A visa is required for citizens of the United States, be it for tourists, education, business, temporary work, or any other reason. In order to request a tourist visa, you must fill out a Visa Request Form and hand it in, together with a valid passport and other required documents for the tourist visa, at your nearest Brazilian Consulate. The Brazilian Consular Network is one of the largest in the world. In the US alone, there are more than ten: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Hartford, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, and Washington. The Consulate Authority will define how long it will take for your visa to be processed. It is a good idea to start the process at least 20 days before your trip. For more detailed information on Brazilian visas, visit the website of the consular office which covers your region. Brazil is currently discussing the issue of electronic visas for citizens of the US and three other countries: Canada, Australia, and Japan. This decision, which should be made by the end of 2017, will make it easier for travelers to get the Brazilian visa. It will turn the whole process of requesting the visa, paying the fee, analysis, approval, and issuance, into a process of 48 hours. And everything will be done online or through an app. Learn more about obtaining a visa to Brazil by visiting the official website of the Brazilian Embassy in Washington DC.

The route network between the US and Brazil: The number of flights between Brazil and the United States has grown more than 50% since 2008, making the US the second country with the most direct connections to Brazil, behind Argentina. It is also one of the most comprehensive, since it contains more than 190 weekly flights that connect 12 American cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Orlando, and Washington) to 9 Brazilian destinations (São Paulo, Campinas, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Recife, Belém, and Manaus).

Traveling in Brazil: The Brazilian domestic route network is one of the most developed in the world – great news for those who do not want to miss the opportunity to get to know several destinations in Brazil. The country has a comprehensive network and good airport infrastructure, which have had major improvements due to the great sporting events hosted by the country in recent years. Other good news is that, since 2002, developments in the sector have reduced the prices of airline tickets for domestic flights approximately 50%, putting them among the cheapest airfares in the world. The foreign tourist coming to Brazil who intends to visit several destinations has another great advantage: the Airpass Brazil. Offered by some Brazilian airlines, the Airpass is a program that allows the tourist to take several flights of his or her own choice by paying a fixed fee. Learn more about the Airpass Brazil here. Besides traveling by plane, traveling by bus in Brazil may also be a good alternative, especially for short trips. The road transport system is efficient and generally offers excellent benefits for low costs. For longer trips, the tourist should choose buses with fully or semi-reclining seats (leito or semi-leito). This way, comfort will be guaranteed for the whole trip!

    "title": "Porto Seguro is the best beach town in the whole world. Here is why.",
    "body": "2017/06/20 - Porto Seguro: My favorite beach in the world: As a ginger kid, beaches and I don’t usually get along so well. I rarely find that the exposure to so much direct sunlight is worth the payoff of the activities which come along with being at the beach. Despite its proximity to the Equator, Porto Seguro in the state of Bahia in Brazil is somehow the perfect beach setup for a ginger like me. There are ample shaded sitting areas directly on the beach and lots of historic sites and tours to occupy yourself with during the peak sun hours. After spending a week in the mountain town of Diamantina for Carnival, visiting the beach scene of Porto Seguro was quite the change of pace. This week at the beach was full diving, flying, learning, dancing, and the makings of an identity story which has been one of my best accounts to-date! This post was written with support from Embratur, which is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism and which operates VisitBrasil. com. They have supplied me with images and marketing support. All views expressed are solely my own and based on my personal experiences and independent research. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Pristine beach, warm water, well-defined local food culture, lots of activities, non-touristic feel, very affordable. Lowlights - You will need cash to pay for most activities in Porto Seguro and all the banks are concentrated away from many of the most interesting sites. Bottom line - Porto Seguro is perhaps the very best beach I have ever visited and had a perfect combination of activity, relaxation, history, and modernity. Celebrity encounters in Porto Seguro: Fred Durst or Judson Moore? My friends and I went by bus to Porto Seguro for spring break. The bus journey from Belo Horizonte, where I was based out of for 6-weeks, was a tiresome overnight ride. The bus was very luxurious and comfortable, but it was a long way to go, lasting around 15 hours. In the middle of the night, we took a small break at a roadside rest area. Brazilian interstates rest areas are very built up, with restaurants and any accommodation you might need on a long-haul. We were a bit hungry, so we go to the buffet to order something. The women taking my order was really shy about it for some reason, and I could see over her shoulder that two of her colleagues were pointing and giggling at me. As an obvious foreigner, I am used to this sort of thing, but this was somehow different. I got my food and went back to the bus. After eating, I started to drift back to sleep and as my head nodded down I caught a glimpse of something. It was the shirt I was wearing. It was a Limp Bizkit t-shirt. And at that moment, I was also wearing a red NY Yankees baseball hat, backward, just like what Fred Durst was known for wearing. Not only was it the same sort of hat, it was THE EXACT same hat because I caught it in a crowd the year before when I saw Limp Bizkit live in Germany! All of a sudden, the behavior at the rest stop made sense. They thought that I was Fred Durst, the singer of Limp Bizkit! This was quite an exciting revelation. So for the week in Porto Seguro, my friends spread rumors that Fred Durst was there somewhere and would ask other people if they had seen him. This rumor spread very quickly and I was quickly surrounded by fans asking for autographs! It was pretty awesome. To give you a little more of a personal look at all the activities I got in to in Porto Seguro, here is a video. It is a bit long, so feel free to jump around the video and find the areas that interest you the most. The Discovery Coast: Porto Seguro is located along what is known as the Discovery Coast. Called this because it is where the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil in 1500. This is where Portuguese colonialism began in Brazil, making it the most historically significant place in the entire country. It is also among the most beautiful places in the country. The beaches feel untouched. There are no major cities for hundreds of miles, no (noticeable) pollution, and everything is left in a very natural state.  Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil, Beach Panoramic. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. The entire coastline is lined with beach huts which play music the whole day and night. There is no lack of facility to relax, a place to sit or layout, or servers to bring you a fresh-cut coconut, pineapple, or a refreshing caipirinha. The beach life in Porto Seguro is both relaxed and energetic at the same time. You will feel the joy, the fun, and the warmth of the Brazilian spirit while being completely relaxed.  Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil, Ponta Grande Beach. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Axé: The Music of Bahia. The Music of Brazil. : Brazil is known for Samba, but in the northern beach territories from Porto Seguro to Salvador, Axé is the music of the land. The music is very rhythmic and inspires a dance, even from the shyest people. Press play below to give it a listen. Let it play out as you read the rest of this post, and feel yourself in the culture of Bahia! Religious symbols of Porto Seguro: As Porto Seguro is the landing site of Portuguese settlers, it also has a large number of churches and many of the oldest buildings in Brazil. The town is scattered with crosses, statues of pilgrims, and other Christian symbols. There are also quite a number of churches. The Nossa Senhora da Pena Church houses many religious paintings from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Church of Our Lady of Mercy features images from the stations of the cross. And the Church of St. Benedict, which was built by the Jesuits and is the site of the first Jesuit school in Brazil. Though not exactly a religious symbol, you must also visit the Discovery Landmark (Marco do Descobrimento) which celebrates the original landing spot of Portuguese settlers to Brazil. It is the Brazilian equivalent to Plymouth Rock in the USA.  Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil, Religious Sculpture. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. What to do in Porto Seguro: Aside from taking in the beach scene and visiting the historic landmarks, there are a lot of shops selling handicrafts and other local fare. There are also a number of open-air nightclubs. I visited during a busy spring break week and apparently, Porto Seguro is a very popular destination for Argentinians on spring break. Though Porto Seguro had a lot of tourists at this time, the numerous nightclubs had a rotating schedule, meaning that on a given night, only one or two clubs would be open. Then on the next night, one or two different clubs would be open. This allowed for each club to have a really busy night and was fun as a tourist, but it also meant that there was lacking freedom of choice about where to go in the evenings. I am ok with that though, as it was still all super fun! Scuba diving in Porto Seguro is a highlight of my entire life’s memories. The waters a warm, clear, and full of beautiful exotic fish and reefs. I have been scuba diving a few times now, but Porto Seguro was my first time. We went out to a major living reef and dove for half an hour with huge angelfish and other colorful ocean creatures. Luckily: no sharks. I think I would have lost my mind if I had seen even a small shark, but that is just me! There are other watercraft activities like the banana ride and parasailing, which I also did. All of this is easily accessible from any beach in Porto Seguro and is quite affordable, so I highly recommend that you do it too! Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil, Historic Center Clouds.

    "title": "Diamantina Brazil is a sleepy town with a party spirit",
    "body": "2017/06/13 - From New Orleans to Diamantina Brazil, Carnival reigns supreme: Diamantina Brazil is a tiny town about 4 hours north of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais. I visited this unlikely party town during the Carnival season and it was full of energy and excitement. I come from the state of Louisiana in the southern part of the USA. In Louisiana, we celebrate Mardi Gras, which is just the French name for Carnival. Needless to say, I felt right at home amongst the street dancing, live music, and historic architecture. Of course, this was no New Orleans Mardi Gras. This was something totally new to me. The conditions more rustic, the air more breathable, the food somehow even more delicious, and the energy electrified by the pure Brazilian spirit. This post was written with support from Embratur, which is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism and which operates VisitBrasil. com. They have supplied me with images and marketing support. All views expressed are solely my own and based on my personal experiences and independent research. In A Nutshell: Highlights - 300-year-old colonial architecture is marvelously preserved, very walkable, UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site, immediate access to beautiful nature, trails, and waterfalls. Lowlights - Lacking public transportation, hilly and uneven surfaces to walk on, far from any major transportation hubs. Bottom line - If you are visiting at Carnival and want the ‘real’ Brazilian experience, or if you are looking to connect with nature and enjoy the great outdoors, then Diamantina might be the very best place in Brazil to visit. Celebrating Carnival in Diamantina: Diamantina is to Carnival in Brazil, what Mamou is to Mardi Gras in Louisiana: a tiny town of just a few thousand inhabitants that most of the year goes unnoticed, but which the whole country turns to at Carnival to host the “local and authentic” celebrations of the holiday. Because the town is so small, there is not enough demand to build up a lot of accommodations in the area.  A quick search on trivago shows 32 hotels in the Diamantina area. Airbnb has almost twice as many listings for private accommodations. That said, if you want to visit for the Carnival, you should book your accommodations well in advance. They will sell out early. Luckily, since Diamantina is so small, you won’t have much trouble navigating your way around once you arrive. The city is built on a hill and the historic cobblestone streets will make walking a challenge even for healthy-kneed youngsters. If you struggle with stairs or rough terrain, then you might want to look elsewhere to celebrate Carnival, as all the streets will be closed to car traffic and you will be forced to walk everywhere. Though you might like to rent a car to drive to Diamantina, you won’t be able to use it too much in the town once you arrive. Going by bus is also a great option and then you don’t have to pay for a car to just sit there for the days of the celebration. However, there are also some really amazing national parks nearby with spectacular hiking and waterfalls which are most easily accessed by car or by hitchhiking. You should also note that during Carnival, access to churches and museums is restricted. Here is a video of the celebratory side of Diamantina during Carnival, featuring my friends Lilian and Glauco, and 18-year-old me. Visiting Diamantina outside of Carnival season: The majority of the year is not Carnival season and so Diamantina turns into a great place for relaxing and connecting with nature and history. Diamantina is listed as a World’s Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO for the role it played in establishing early Brazilian colonial wealth. As you might have guessed by the name, the area is rich in mineral resources, most notably, diamonds. Diamantina has been masterfully preserved through the centuries and since it never expanded into a major metropolitan area, pretty much the whole town is in the original footprint. There are several notable figures to come out of Diamantina. In particular, Juscelino Kubitschek, who was the president of Brazil in the 1950’s, and who constructed the modern-day federal capital of Brasilia. I find it fascinating that such a small and historic colonial town produced the person who in addition to leading the country at a very important time, also envisioned the creation of a modern and planned capital city.  Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Street Scene. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. A walking tour of Diamantina Brazil: No visit to Diamantina is going to be complete without simply walking around the town. Wear sturdy comfortable shoes and get ready to burn some calories. And be sure to carry water with you. As you can see in this photo, the streets are hilly, sidewalks intermittent at best, and the streets are pretty rough. This is all very charming and beautiful, but when it comes to walking around, just watch your step.  Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Steep Streets Landscape. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. St. Anthony Cathedral in Diamantina: The St. Anthony Cathedral is the center point of Diamantina. Though the building’s architecture looks quite old, it is a fairly modern construction, built just in 1940. The original building was built a hundred years earlier, but when the seat of the church was upgraded to a cathedral, this new building was built. Despite that, the towering facade and the Baroque interior make an impression and really highlight European colonialism in Diamantina. Though the church is closed during Carnival, it is wall-to-wall people in every direction on the streets during the celebration.  Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil, St. Anthony Cathedral Side. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank.  Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil, St. Anthony Cathedral Front. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Igreja Nossa Senhora do Carmo: Just a 3-minute walk southeast of the St. Anthony Cathedral is the Igreja Nossa Senhora do Carmo. This church is much smaller than the cathedral but it is the original building from 1766, making it much more historic. The interior is far more impressive with its wall paintings, carvings, and gilded reliefs. This architectural style extends beyond the churches of Diamantina to the early colonial estates. Though the estates are mostly privately owned and therefore hard to get into, the churches offer a view into Brazilian colonial style.

    "title": "Belo Horizonte is a historic and cultural capital of Brazil",
    "body": "2017/06/06 - Belo Horizonte Travel Guide: Belo Horizonte is Brazil’s sixth-largest city and the capital of the state of Minas Gerais. This well-planned city has sprawling tree-lined boulevards and ample green space to enjoy. The surrounding area is full of colonial historical sites and other great destinations, such as Ouro Preto. If you are into nature, history, art, or nightlife, Belo Horizonte is a great destination to include on your next trip to Brazil. I came to Belo Horizonte to visit my friend Lilian and her now husband, Glauco. I knew Lilian from my Rotary Youth Exchange year in Germany. Lilian and her family would later host me for 6-weeks while I explored Belo Horizonte and the surrounding area. It came to feel like home fairly quickly. In this Belo Horizonte Travel Guide, I will recount the highlights of my favorite places in the city. This post was written with support from Embratur, which is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism and which operates VisitBrasil. com. They have supplied me with images and marketing support. All views expressed are solely my own and based on my personal experiences and independent research. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Panoramic views, art, culture, music, a wide verity of classical and modern architecture, and proximity to many other amazing destinations off the typical tourist path. Lowlights - Located far from other major tourist centers make getting here a a bit hard unless you fly. Bottom line - Belo Horizonte is a beautiful city with lots to offer. Despite being far from other popular destinations, there is plenty to explore in the immediate area which would be enough to make any trip to Brazil a success all by its self. Praça da Liberdade (Freedom Square): In the center of Belo Horizonte’s original planned city stands a number of historic sites and buildings, but none as beautiful as Praça da Liberdade. The square is full of neck bending palm trees and other flora which have been magnificently manicured for over a century.  On the surface are charming cobblestone paths and lots of seating. It is easy to see the inspirations this square takes from the grounds at the Palace of Versailles. Taking a short breather here or staying few hours to enjoy the nature and read a book will be time well-spent if you are looking to relax. The square is surrounded by a number of historic buildings, including the old governor’s mansion and an apartment building designed by Oscar Niemeyer, a founder of modern architecture. So regardless of what aesthetic you are looking for, you can find nature, history, and modernity all within one view from the Praça da Liberdade. The area around the square is designated as a cultural center called Circuito Cultural Praça da Liberdade (The Cultural Circuit of Freedom Square). This zone recognizes the historical significance of the space and the buildings which shaped Brazil’s history for more than a century. In this area, there are more than a dozen institutions, museums, and cultural centers.  Belo Horizonte, Brasil, Minas Gerais, Praça da liberdade. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. The Seat of Government: At the southern end of Freedom Park is the Palácio da Liberdade. This is the original state capital of Minas Gerais and is fashioned after European palaces. Though not as large as palaces you can find in Europe, if you take a tour of the inside, you will be blown away by the neoclassical architecture and paintings. Today the Palácio da Liberdade acts as a tourist attraction and is only put into official service during the transfer of power ceremonies between elected officials.  Belo Horizonte, Brasil, Minas Gerais, Palácio da Liberdade. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Museums reflect the rich history of Minas Gerais: The name of the state Belo Horizonte is in is Minas Gerais, which translates to “the managed mines. ” The region is rich in natural resources and was once Brazil’s greatest source of domestic wealth. The original state capital, Ouro Preto, is named for the black gold which brought wealth to the area in colonial times. The history of Brazil is fueled by gold, and that gold came from this area of Brazil. Therefore, it is well worth taking the time to explore the museums which covers this topic. Further Reading: Ouro Preto Brazil is the heart of Brazil, Revolution, and an economic explosion There are many museums in Belo Horizonte, but perhaps the most unique is the Museu do metal. This museum tells the history of metal in Brazil. The precious ores have been at the heart of Brazil’s economic success, and their ability to be among the world’s emerging superpowers. The museum is a modern structure with breathtaking architecture, play on light, reflection, and metal of every shape, size, and color.  Belo Horizonte, Brasil, Minas Gerais, Museu do metal. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Arts, crafts, and rainbows make a splash: On a hot summer day in Belo Horizonte, you will find the streets lined with artisans selling handy crafts typical of the area. So renowned are these artistic goods that there is a museum dedicated to showcasing the hand crafted art of the region. The Palácio de artes e ofícios (Handy Craft Museum) is a great place to cool down and escape the mid-day sun. Even if you don’t go in the museum, you can find artisans in the plaza out front and cool down with a dance in the water fountains. It is also a great place to catch a rainbow on a cloudless day! Belo Horizonte, Brasil, Minas Gerais, Palácio de artes e ofícios. Courtesy Embratur Image Bank. Panoramic City Views: Belo Horizonte is built in a hilly area, which provides ample locations to take in breathtaking panoramic views of the modern city. I spent many evenings watching the sunset from these viewing points and I can’t recommend it to you enough. There is something magical about Brazilian sunsets!  Here are two places I can recommend for catching the panoramic view of Belo Horizonte:    Porcão BH Avenida Raja Gabaglia, 2985, Cep:30350-540, Tel: (31) 3293-8604. This is a very famous steak house in Belo Horizonte and it is a bit pricey as well. But the price tag comes with a real value when you watch the transition from day to dusk to night. Pro Tip: check the events calendar on their Facebook page for live performances by local artists in Belo Horizonte.     Alta Vila Tower - Located in the district of Nova Lima on the south side of Belo Horizonte, this tower offers a spectacular view of Belo Horizonte and its surrounding mountains but without the hefty price tag of Porcão BH.  If you get hungry then you are in luck, because on the first floor is the Belo Horizonte Hard Rock Cafe!

How to get more information about Belo Horizonte: There is a wealth of additional information about Belo Horizonte on VisitBrasil. com. If you are planning a trip to the area, I encourage you to visit that resource. Also, do please leave me a comment below with questions or comments from your own experiences in Belo Horizonte. I wish you a wonderful time in this great city of Brazil! "

    "title": "Weekend Trips - Quick Tips for the Jetsetter and Novice Traveler Alike",
    "body": "2017/04/27 - So this is kind of a comprehensive mini-guide to traveling, inspired by my travels around Southeast Asia. These are the best tips and tricks for quick, easy, and affordable travel; good for everything from studying abroad to weekend trips and road-tripping around your state. Special thanks to Michelle, Annie, Britt, and Eileen for contributing ♥ you guys are great. You can also check out my photo journals for Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Cambodia! Preparing for a weekend trip: 1. Get a good credit card - This is a good contingency plan to have for emergencies. Of course, if it’s just a one-time trip, it may not justify committing to a credit card, but if you’re a frequent traveler, I highly recommend it. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is extolled as one of the best cards for travelers, because you get 50,000 free points if you spend $4,000 in three months (use it to book your flight and that’s easily a couple hundred dollars in a day), and you get one point for every dollar you spend and 2x points for food and travel, even grocery shopping. But the best part is that you can use it almost anywhere in the world, without foreign transaction fees, which can add up over time. I swear I’m not sponsored by Chase (although @Chase if you wanna get on that, I’m all for it). Disclaimer: The link above is an affiliate link, so I get a lil something if you sign up for a card, too! Win-win. 2. Get cash beforehand - Always a smart idea. And a lot of smaller countries, especially in Southeast Asia, won’t accept credit cards at a lot of locations. If you want to be really smart about it, change currencies where the exchange rate is most advantageous to you. 3. Print stuff - Print everything! Your hotel/Airbnb reservations, your airline check-in confirmations, your itineraries. You never know when you’ll need it. 4. Do your research - Check travel blogs, Wikipedia pages, government websites. Get a general sense of the rules, customs, and attitudes of the country you’re visiting. You don’t want to go to the Vatican wearing shorts (ask me about the time I wore my cousin’s baby blanket around my waist so I could see the inside of St. Peter’s Basilica). You also don’t want to be fined, arrested, or offend the locals. Getting There: 1. Book early - This one goes without saying, but you really can save a lot of money by booking in advance. Tickets are usually cheapest six to eight weeks before your trip. 2. Look for deals and compare - See: Why Flying is So Expensive, for a dissection of airline ticket prices. Check budget airline sites like Scoot or Tigerair if you’re in Asia and EasyJet, Ryanair, or Vueling if you’re in Europe. Good options (for the US and internationally): Google Flights, momondo, SkyScanner, Kiwi, and STA Travel (I like Google Flights for the clean and easy-to-use UI). If you’re super-into planning, most of these websites let you set up price alerts where they’ll email you when the flight you’re eyeing drops, or set specific dates with apps like Hopper to get notifications for cheap flights tailored to your itinerary. Or you can subscribe to travel sites like TravelZoo, which uses your area code to send you special flash deals on flights and hotels. You can also go to SkyScanner and input the destination as “everywhere” if you want a cheap flight and you’re not picky about where you go. 3. Book on a Tuesday or a Sunday - Airlines find out if their flights will be full on that day and adjust their prices accordingly, and lower their rates on weekends to attract leisure travelers, so plan to book on a Tuesday, and if there are no deals, try the following Sunday. 4. Browse in incognito - Anyone who has studied economics has probably heard of price discrimination, but it’s applicable to flights as well. Airlines reserve some seats at low prices to attract customers initially, but if the tickets up selling well, the airline can increase the price. It is debatable whether or not your browsing history or cookies actually have an effect on this, but it is common knowledge that airlines offer several different price points for each seat which can change by the hour, so just to be safe, I’d recommend it anyway. 5. Don’t travel on peak days or during peak hours - Try to avoid weekends (Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays) and after-work hours (6 pm to 9 pm). Flights outside of these times will likely be cheaper, less crowded, and less likely to be delayed. Another basic economic principle: supply and demand. 6. Book separate flights - Sometimes booking a trip in parts is less expensive than booking a round-trip ticket (see my trip to Chicago and New York). Or, fly to a different destination first and find alternative transportation (I did this in Cambodia when I took a six-hour night bus to Phnom Penh). 7. Check out alternative transportation - In some places like Europe, it can be cheaper and less hassle to take a train. The U. K. has an underwater train that is much faster, cheaper, and often more convenient than flying. Packing for a weekend trip: 1. Pack light - It’s best to carry as little as possible when you’re going on short trips. Take a backpack for clothes and things, and then a small bag for walking around. Checking bags on a plane is expensive, and sometimes the only place you can put your belongings is a locker, so it’s smartest to keep all of your things together. 2. The basics - File these under “Crucial to Survival,” because these things should be in every solo traveler’s arsenal. These are your absolute essentials. These things will save your life because you will find that if you have them and don’t need them then it’s a minor inconvenience, but if you need them and don’t have them…it can be a major crisis. And you never know where the next convenience store will be.    A small lock (a lot of hostels have lockers, but you have to bring your own lock)     Portable phone charger     Camera/GoPro     Sunscreen     Lip balm     Hand sanitizer     Tissues (in case you need napkins or toilet paper because some places in Europe and Asia you need to pay for it)     Sanitizing wipes (hotels/hostels = so many germs)     Baby wipes  3. The extras - Boy Scout’s motto: Always be prepared (ALSO the Girl Scout’s motto!). These things aren’t 100% necessary, but they’re nice to have, and they’ll definitely make your trip more comfortable.    Oil-blotting sheets     Money belt/fanny pack     Pepper spray     Bug spray     Portable fan     Microfiber towel (this is very useful if you’ve got limited space in your bag)     A plastic folder (to keep your passport, your ticket, and paper documents in one place)  Weekend trip accommodation: 1. Hotels - A standard choice. Except now there are so many smarter ways to book, like through apps like Hotel Tonight, which offers last-minute hotel deals for cheap. 2. Airbnb - Airbnb is a great option, easy-to-use, and super-convenient. This is usually a safe choice, because the owners are vetted, and you can read community reviews. You can choose to rent out a room, a whole house, or even just a bed in a hostel. 3. Hostels - Hostels perfect for budget travelers. They’re generally cheaper than hotels, they sometimes offer free meals, and they’re an excellent way to get to know the area around you and meet other travelers. “Designer hostels” are becoming very popular; they’re clean, safe, and often very centrally-located. Many of them can be booked through Airbnb or Hostel World. 4. Map it out - Before you book anywhere, consider how accessible it is. Is it close to the airport or the train station? Is it near restaurants or convenience stores or any of the things you want to see while you’re there? Make a plan on Google Maps so you have a relative sense of how far everything is. Getting around: 1. Uber/lyft - Honestly, on-call cars are a great option. I took five Ubers in one day while I was in Malaysia. But you can download local taxi apps as well (in the Singapore there’s Grab, in Budapest, there’s Fotaxi, etc. ) 2. Public transport - In Asia (the richer countries like China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan), the MRT is super efficient and pretty reasonable, so it’s worth it. I’ve never taken public transport in Europe, but apparently, the buses are excellent. 3. Apps - Use apps to determine the quickest way to get around. CiyMapper, Transit App, Moovit, and even Google Maps are all great options. 4. Safety - Be careful! The public transportation in some countries (like Malaysia) is very unreliable and/or dangerous. It’s worth it to spend extra money for the sake of safety. Things to do on a weekend trip: 1. Make an itinerary - Do a quick Google search for “things to do in [country]” and start there. If you have limited time, it’s best to have a plan, even if you don’t end up following it. But it’ll give you an outline of what your day will look like, and help you determine the most efficient way to get around. 2. Read travel blogs - I read a lot of these. They show you where other people have been, and where good places for travelers are.    Leave Your Daily Hell: I really like this one. I feel like a larger percentage of bloggers are female than male, so sometimes a guy’s perspective can be refreshing. He’s also a professional travel planner, so his sample travel itineraries are super-informative and inspirational.     LonelyPlanet: One of the most comprehensive travel sites.     Nomadic Matt: He writes a lot of good articles on real travel advice, like “Why It’s Never The Right Time to Travel” and “The Ultimate Guide to Traveling When You Have No Money. ”     Be My Travel Muse: A great travel blog written with a focus on solo female travel and little-known destinations.     Travelettes: This one is written by all-female contributors, who share stories about their personal experiences in different countries.     PROJECT INSPO: Jinna started writing this blog after her father died, quitting her Manhattan job as a fashion photographer, and spending 11 months traveling the world with one suitcase and a cardboard cutout of her father. She has a lot of good tips on minimalist/solo traveling, and also some inspiration pieces to get you moving! (Check out the article I wrote for PROJECT INSPO about working holiday visas here!)  3. Ask locals/natives - Most people will do this anyway, but if you have any friends, family, or family friends who are from the country or state you plan on visiting, ask them! They know their country/state better than anyone and can likely give you the best recommendations that won’t be on TripAdvisor. It’s also how I decide where to stay. 4. Instagram - My friend mentioned that this is a good place to find food recommendations, and it’s definitely a good option if you want to find out what other people are doing (or eating). It’s like getting personalized recommendations from 600 million of your closest friends. 5. Tours - Lots of tourist destinations and landmarks are easily traversed by bus, like in the U. K. or some major U. S. cities. Ever been on a Hop-On Hop-Off bus? They’re spectacularly touristy, but also awesome because you can get to a bunch of different locations on a single route. Or you can use sites like FreeCityTour for more ideas/pre-planned routes. Happy traveling! "

    "title": "An Interview with Global Skier Laura Davies of the ForeverWinter Project",
    "body": "2017/04/18 - I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Laura Davies as she pursues an epic journey chasing winter around the world. The ForeverWinter Project is Laura’s dream to spend a year skiing a different country every month. As ambitious as that may sound, as you will read in the following interview, she is set to far surpass her goal and to experience many other unknowable things. Be sure to follow The ForeverWinter Project on Instagram @ForeverWinterProject. “ForeverWinter Project” is a unique name for your adventure. What inspired this name?: I always loved the name Never Summer and thought it would be cool to have a skier brand with a similarly clever name. My friend Tim and I jokingly came up with the name ForeverWinter over beers, but we didn’t have anything concrete to apply the name to. Once I started to plan the first trip I knew that ForeverWinter Project was the perfect name for my goal to ski around the world.  So what exactly is “ForeverWinter Project”?: ForeverWinter Project is both a personal goal and an inspiration for skiing enthusiasts, particularly women. The personal aspect of the project is for me to ski a different country every month for a full year, traveling to over 30 countries in total. I am hoping to also launch a blog that will serve as a resource for other skiers. We are going to feature a different female every two weeks to showcase all the amazing things women are doing in the ski industry. Additionally, there will be information about my travels and tips for other skiers, male and female alike. Life is about the journey, not the destination. What is your #1 highlight of your current journey?: I worked in corporate healthcare for five years before starting ForeverWinter Project. Over time, I felt as though I had hit a wall in terms of what I was able to learn in my role at the company. I took what I had learned about sales and marketing and applied it to my passion for skiing. While I obviously love the trips, my favorite part has been learning new career skills like social media marketing and blogging. It feels very empowering to make mistakes and celebrate successes on my own terms. Drinking a Pisco Sour at Hotel Portillo was a pretty big highlight too! Any tips for where / how others can also learn these skills? Any favorite online resources? Or is it a combination of being self-taught and learning from the people you meet while on your adventure?: I love the wisdom of surrounding yourself with people who are much smarter than yourself. However, you also need to ask those people good questions to learn from their wisdom – just being around them isn’t going to be much help. Every time I have tried to learn a new skill for this project I have sought guidance from people in my circle who know more than I do. If I don’t know anyone with the particular skill I am trying to develop I ask for introductions until I find the right person. Be kind, smile, and listen. Do those things and you’ll be surprised how willing people are to help. You chose to spend five years working before traveling, were there benefits to choosing your time for extended travel?: My parents were gracious enough to provide me with a wonderful higher education. During that time, they would often remind me: “four years and you are off the payroll. ” After graduating the reality of what “adult life” costs set in fast and I knew I needed to make some money. I was hired by a healthcare company in Denver and started a job I loved and learned a lot from. Taking those first years to work helped better prepare me for travel in three significant ways:  I have the means to travel. There are plenty of blogs/articles on how to travel cheaply, but skiing is not a cheap hobby. Saving throughout those first five years for a previously undetermined purpose gave me the funds to pursue ForeverWinter Project when I finally came up with the idea.  I have a career I can return to. Having spent five years focusing on hiring as part of my job, I firmly believe that it is a lot easier to get in the door when you have work experience or directly out of college. If you decide to travel right after graduating, you may find it initially more difficult to break into your desired field.  There are certain skills I developed while working which make traveling easier. I improved my budgeting, presentation, and interview skills which help me keep the project moving forward. Additionally, working with several former consultants taught me the value of credit card and airline points which have saved me thousands of dollars in plane tickets. Switching from healthcare to skiing must require some industry specific resources. Where can the reader start seeking out those resources?: Some of my favorite resources for skiing are: powderhounds. com, Telegraph, and a company called Scout Ski. Scout Ski noticed a similar gap in ski trip resources and will actually help plan your entire international ski trip. While each of these websites has pieces of information for skiing internationally, I hope foreverwinterproject. com can help combine the best tips and provide new information about more remote destinations such as Kashmir or Kazakhstan. Being independent does not mean going it alone. Who most influenced you in your pursuit of ForeverWinter Project, and how?: The list of people I need to thank is continually growing. That said, a Vice President I worked with at my previous company named Ian really helped bring the idea to life. One day we were sitting in his office talking about the possibility of business school, and he was encouraging me to take a few months off to travel before starting an MBA program. I told him the idea of unstructured travel didn’t really appeal to me to which he quickly replied: “Alright then, what would you do?” After a few minutes of being shocked that I had never considered what I would do if I had the time and money to do whatever I wanted, it became clear: I would ski. I would spend as many days as possible traveling the world, just to ski. From that point forward, there was no turning back. I fell in love with the idea and spent as much time as possible trying to turn it into a reality. On January 13, 2017, I left my job and started pursuing my new adventure full time. What does it take to pull a journey like this off?: I think pulling off any large scale international trip requires flexibility and commitment to be successful, especially when extreme sports are involved. I spent about 6 months formulating the idea for the project and getting input from friends and family. Once I felt like I had a clear goal in mind, to ski in at least one different country every month of the year, I committed myself to restructuring everything in my life to help achieve that goal. I sold everything I owned that someone was willing to buy, got rid of my apartment, quit my job, and had to end a relationship, all in the hopes that this dream will be successful Once I hit the road full time I realized my idea of a successful, picture-perfect trip was far from the realities of travel. I have had to reschedule multiple legs of my trips due to injury or problems with flights (delays, pilot strikes, visa issues) and rather than stress about something you can’t change you need to open your mind to the new opportunities that your situation creates. The best example I have of this is while skiing in Kazakhstan my binding malfunctioned and sent me flying out of my skis down the hill. I injured my knee severely and had to take several weeks to rest. Rather than fly back to the states or sit in a hotel room in cry (okay, I cried about it a little…) I called a friend that was traveling to Thailand and by agreeing to join him for a week we were able to pool enough money to sail around Thailand for a week! Talk about a lucky-unlucky situation. I have thought a lot about what “empowerment” is and have come to believe it is a combination of three things: ability, permission, and desire. Do you agree or disagree? How has ForeverWinter Project made you more empowered?: I absolutely agree and as a female traveler, I think the permission aspect is one of the toughest things to embrace. Solo travel is about self-discovery and therefore is inherently a little “selfish. ” I’ve talked to a lot of women about the burden of feeling that we need to care for others, build families, etc. I’m from Texas and almost everyone I know is married, I get it. At the same time, I truly believe you cannot care for anyone until you take care of yourself, and ForeverWinter Project is giving me the time to explore my passions intensely and unapologetically. You’re only going to get a few chances in life to do something big, and countless friends and mentors in their 30’s and 40’s pushed me to do this while I’m young. I might be broke in six months from this trip but I can honestly say I’ve never felt more empowered. While traveling one can always expect a bit of the unexpected – what’s the craziest thing you have encountered? While I was skiing in Las Trancas, Chile, some friends and I were enjoying a mid-mountain beer at the lodge when the volcano we were skiing on started to erupt. We didn’t realize what was happening or how serious the situation was until the chefs at the lodge ran outside and got on their skis. That’s when you know it’s time to go! "

    "title": "10 Questions to Ask Before You Book a Riad in Morocco",
    "body": "2017/04/12 - The allure of Morocco: Morocco is among the most alluring and mystical destinations in the world. Its easy access from Europe and North America place it as a great port of entry into the MENA region and the rich and colorful cultures of the Arab world. The former French colonial influences of Morocco provide some hints of Western familiarity, while still being genuinely its own place, with parts seemingly untouched for a thousand years. Part of what makes a trip to Morocco particularly worthwhile is the ability to safely explore nearly any part of the country without fear of dangers. From the High Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert, and the relaxed beaches of Casablanca and Rabat, this North African paradise has something to offer every traveler: peace of mind. Morocco has its risks, just as anywhere in the world does, and if you want to be more educated about that, I encourage you to read the Morocco country profile on state. gov. The more ancient cities, Marrakesh and Fez, in particular, are well known for their well-preserved city centers (medinas) which have seen little change in many hundreds of years. If you are going to spend time in a Moroccan city, then you are going to spend time in the medina. And if you are going to spend time in the medina, then you may as well make it your home for a few days by staying in a riad. What is a Moroccan riad?: Riads are the traditional homes of Morocco and are found everywhere in the medinas. Riads have inward-focused architecture, with all rooms opening inward to atrium and garden, often times with a fountain. This inward design provides protection from the weather and gives residence maximum privacy and tranquility from the hectic streets just outside. The architectural features are often very detailed in mosaics and colorfully painted wood with beautiful Islamic and Berber designs. As much as I can rave about how wonderful riads are, they are not for everyone, or for every trip type. Depending on your own amenities needs, trip requirements, and certain sensitivities, a riad might not be for you. That is why, though I strongly encourage you to stay in a riad, I first encourage you to first ask yourself (or the riad under consideration) a few questions before you book a riad to make sure that you are going to fully appreciate and enjoy your time. Here are some questions that I learned to ask about booking a riad in Morocco. 1. How do I find the Riad?:       Knowing where your riad is at on a map is one thing, but finding it in the layberanth of a madina is another all together. Mapping apps are less reliable here, but one host gave me the tip to use the app Galileo (iOS    Android), which is an off-line map. I found it to be quite accurate a real lifesaver while between Wi-Fi hotspots. Still, your initial arrival to the riad can be quite tricky. It is advisable to arrange your host to meet you at a landmark and walk you to the riad. If you are just arriving to the city and have luggage, then the riad can send a taxi for you. This might be a bit expensive, but will serve you well for the ease and peace of mind.    2. Can I carry my luggage very far, and through narrow, hilly streets?: Medinas are huge areas. In fact, the Fez medina is the world’s largest car-free metropolitan area, and it is built on a rather steep hillside. The roads (more like paths, really) through the medinas are narrow, rugged, and often busy with people and mules. These labyrinths are also dizzying to the most directional-savvy traveler. So before you get lost in there trying to find your riad, make sure you are up to carrying your luggage around with you under those conditions. The Marrakech medina is much flatter and has broader roads, but the paths are even more busy with people and vendors. At the entrance of every medina you can find porters to carry your things with you, but be wary of scams. The best case is if you can get your riad to send someone to meet and walk with you. 3. Is the Riad wheelchair accessible?: I can answer this one for you: no. Medinas are not very accessible in general, and riads even less so. You can find some more modern riads on the edge of the medina, or even outside of the center, and these might be more accessible. If mobility is a concern for you, then I would caution you in your pursuit of a Moroccan trip in general. When I visited, I was in the 4th-month of recovery of a minor knee surgery. Even I could go hiking for 2 days in the High Atlas mountains, but getting around the riad was a challenge! 4. How important is reliable or fast internet to me?: Every riad I have looked at has advertised Wi-Fi, but you should take that with a grain of salt. Even if there is Wi-Fi, there is likely only a trickle of internet bandwidth. If you are relying on your lodging to provide you with the internet for uploading your days’ worth of selfies, this might not work out so well. Likewise, if you need to be connected to the Internet for work or other purposes, then a riad is likely not going to be the best fit for you.  5. Is the room on the first floor?: I strongly recommend avoiding rooms on the first floor. Rooms on the first floor are smaller, darker, and open up directly into the small public space where everyone will be coming and going, and having their meals. That means you will be losing the most amount of privacy on the first floor, as well as receiving the most interruptions from others. On the other hand, the non-ground level floors will have balcony access, more privacy, are typically larger spaces, and are very quiet. 6. Does my sleeping room have natural light?: Since riads rarely have outward-facing windows you might go crazy if you crave natural light. The rooms are often dark and poorly lit. This adds to the charm and authentic feel of the space, but you should know up front that your room will be more like a cave than a canopy. 7. How sensitive am I to smell?: Food, fragrances, gasses, animals and people are all sources of strong and varied smells. Each of these things can be pleasant or putrid. As the traditional riads are very old structures, you can count on their plumbing to be ancient as well. There can easily be some degree of smell in your riad and as you sleep, so if you are super sensitive to smell, then just go cautiously. In my experience, the ground-floor rooms could be a bit smellier than the upper floors. Just like with the smells, riads can be noisy places if you are on the first floor. Any room not on the first floor should be just fine, though, and offer you more silence than you would get at home or at a modern hotel.  8. Can you accommodate my dietary restrictions?: If you are a vegetarian, then you will have no problem eating very well in Morocco. I especially recommend the couscous. But couscous is most notably not gluten free, and finding gluten-free anything other than straight fruits and vegetables could prove challenging. The kitchen at the riad will be as accommodating as possible, but any preference you have, you should state before they start cooking any meal you request them to make. I was never handed a menu at a riad. I was simply asked if I wanted dinner or breakfast or not. So be specific up front and ask questions about the food. 9. Do you accept credit cards for incidentals?: You might book you riad online in advance, but that does not mean that the riad can accept card payment on-site. Generally speaking, Morocco is a cash economy. If you rack up any incidental costs from the riad (taxi, meals, spa, etc…) then be sure to know in advance how you are going to pay for it at the end of your stay. 10. What recommendations can the Riad give you?: Riad owners and managers know everything about the city and everyone in it. Peer into that knowledge and experience but always be willing to go it alone in the end rather than simply take their advice. You will quickly learn in Morocco that the phrase “you’re welcome” is the Indian equivalent of “my friend. ” This is not to say that they do not genuinely welcome you to their country, their shop, or their home, but just know that nothing is free and you will be expected to pay something for just about everything, no matter what expectation you inferred at the beginning of a deal (which you may or may not even be aware you are making until it is already made). And now the real question: where can I book a riad in Morocco?: Many riads are bookable online and through tour operators. Though not a search filter on most booking sites, you can quickly identify the riads on these great booking resources just by looking at the photos and location.  http://www. riadsmorocco. com http://www. airbnb. com http://www. booking. comIf you have been to Morocco and stayed at a riad, I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!

    "title": "Young, free, and female. How to be happy in a world full of choice and pressure.",
    "body": "2017/03/21 - Being happy starts and ends with you: Life is short. Sometimes I feel like it was just yesterday that I was a freshman moving into my dorm room and sometimes that feels like forever ago (even though it was only 4 and a half years ago). Some days I’d give anything to go back and relive my freshman year of college and others I cringe at the thought of having to relive that period of my life. There are days when I still feel like a little kid who just needs her mom and days when I feel like an independent woman just trying to make her way in the world. But when it comes down to it, no matter how long ago college feels or how long ago it actually was, I am still young. And I will continue to be young for at least another few years. So, what I’ve realized is that while we’re young, we need to do what makes us happy. For me, happiness comes from traveling and seeing the world. It’s living in different cultures and experiencing things that I never thought I would. It’s meeting new people and seeing the world through their lens, even if only for a day. It’s staying up to FaceTime my family so they don’t forget about me while I’m gone for months at a time. It’s long flights, lots of coffee, a strong cocktail, and many, many, countries. It’s a new adventure every chance I get.  Think my life peaked at Samet NangsheA post shared by tarahmason (@tarahmason) on Nov 27, 2016 at 3:40pm PST For you, happiness might be starting your career. It might be living in the small town you grew up in. It might be getting married and having kids. It might be getting that promotion at work. It might be going back to school. My point is, happiness is relative. : What makes me happy, could very well make someone else quite miserable. In a world where more and more millennials are choosing to travel the world instead of start a career, don’t ever feel bad about choosing your career over travel. Don’t ever question your desire to move back to the small town that you grew up in. Don’t think that you are any less than anyone else because you’ve chosen to live in the house you grew up in instead of get an apartment with your friends. Don’t second guess your decision to pursue your career instead of backpacking Southeast Asia. However, don’t be afraid to take chances. Don’t say no to a weekend away because you are too focused on work. Don’t be afraid to move out or to take a vacation or to try something new. On the other hand, if you lead a life of travel and constant adventure, don’t be afraid to say yes to settling down. Don’t be afraid to start your career and build a family. Our twenties are a time where we’re still figuring it out, and that’s okay. It’s okay to feel lost and to have no idea what you’re doing, but it’s not okay to settle. It’s not okay to settle because you are too afraid of the alternative. Don’t ignore the voice in your head wondering, “what if…” because that voice will never go away. Whatever path you choose, make sure it’s the one that is going to fulfill you. Make sure it’s the one that your heart is begging you to follow. Make sure it’s the one that is going to make you truly happy. Don’t worry. Be happy. : While we’re young, we need to do the things that make us happy. Because if we’re not happy now, how can we expect to be happy when we have a mortgage, a car payment, and an overdue credit card to pay? How can we expect to be happy when we spent all of our twenties being unhappy? How can we expect to be happy when we’ve spent most of our lives trying to make someone else happy? How can we expect to be happy if we’ve never truly done what has made us happy? We were made to be different. We were made to have opposing views. We were made to have our own opinions and thoughts. We were made to find our own happiness. So figure out what that is and go after it. Go after it with everything you have and never apologize. Live your twenties, and the rest of your life for that matter, doing what makes you happy. Happiness in action: What makes you happy? What is the very last thing that made you smile? What thought about your future makes you smile the most? Are you actively pursuing your ‘what if’ and preparing for a happy life?

    "title": "Best podcast 2017 - What I listen to for my daily dose of inspiration",
    "body": "2017/03/15 - Since I was a teenager, I have been a bit of a political junkie. I grew up in a politically active family, I studied political science at university, and I have lobbied Congress more times than I can recall. So as you might imagine, I absorbed every ounce of news coverage and reading that I could during the last U. S. presidential election. By the time the party conventions arrived in July 2016, I was so burned out on the divisive and toxic nature of the whole thing that I was desperate for something new. I turned to podcasts. Podcasts were the perfect way for me to stay engaged, get inspired, and continue the pursuit of knowledge while on the go or while busy with other tasks like cooking, cleaning, or getting ready in the morning. The political podcasts go deep into the issues and the debates. The business podcasts really help you learn new tangible skills and ways of thinking. And the entertaining podcasts are as quality as anything you would find on Netflix. NPR has recently been promoting a #TryPod challenge. The premise of the challenge is that those of us who listen to podcasts should share our favorite podcasts with our friends, family, and the world. Well NPR: challenge accepted! Here is my #TryPod answer, and my list for Best Podcast 2017. Please leave a comment below about what your favorite podcasts are. 1. How I Built This: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: NPR | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherThis podcast is a weekly discussion with innovators, entrepreneurs, and idealists who have launched global movements ranging from airlines to clothiers, and from early computing to the latest sharing economy trends. How I Built This has become my favorite podcast because I always learn something fascinating, I get inspired to continue work toward building on my own passions, and most importantly, we come to understand how some of the most well-recognized people and products all started with humble beginnings. The lessons to learn here are that if they can do it, so can you. So listen to How I Built This and find the inspiration and strength to follow your own passions! 2. ProBlogger Podcast: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: Darren Rowse | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherHost and producer Darren Rowse is an early adopter to blogging. He has been blogging for some 15 years and has learned a lot along the way as he blazed the trail for other would-be bloggers. His podcast is full of tips, insights, best practices and encouragement for you (yes, you!) to write a blog and, if you so desire, to monetize it. He is currently nearing his 200th episode and I can hardly think of a topic he has yet to cover. The first 30 episodes are a “30 days to built a better blog challenge,” where he goes through the best actions you can take over a 30 day period to get your blog up and running and generating traffic. Even if you are not interested in blogging, some of the tips he shares are very useful in other areas of life. I highly recommend you give ProBlogger Podcast a listen! 3. Freakonomics Radio: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: WNYC | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherFrom the authors of the Freakonomics book series which has found a way to explain the essence of economics to millions of people in an interesting and engaging way, this podcasts explores the hidden side of everything and lays out the rules of economics as they apply to every aspect of life and human development. More than just interviews and high-level learning, the Freakonomics Radio podcast is storytelling at its finest. 4. TED Radio Hour: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: NPR and TED | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherIf you are familiar with TED Talks, then you are already familiar with the TED Radio Hour Podcast. This is the radio version of the popular TED videos. What I think makes this even more interesting is that rather than focusing on a single talk, they focus on a topic and then highlight various TED Talks which are on that topic. You will hear excerpts from the original TED Talk in addition to interviews with the speakers for the purpose of this podcast. Even if you have watched every TED Talk, you will get the opportunity go dive a little deeper into each topic here. 5. More Perfect: Frequency: Weekly / Seasonally | Produced By: WNYC’s Radiolab | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherI just recently started listening to More Perfect and think it might be one of the more important podcasts you can listen to. It did a limited-run mini-series in 2016 but season 2 is slated for launch later in 2017. The podcast covers important Supreme Court decisions in America. This may sound very dry, but I promise you that More Perfect paints a vibrant picture of how these decisions impact the daily lives of “We, the people. ” There are court rulings here that you are aware of and ones you have never heard of, but what you are sure to learn is that indeed, this far away court does influence your life in more ways than you likely appreciate today. 6. This American Life: Frequency: Weekly / Seasonally | Produced By: Chicago Public Media | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherA great classic! This American Life has been produced for over two decades, has more than 600 episodes, and yet somehow the topics never seem to overlap or repeat. This American Life broadcasts on Sundays, so I listen to it on Monday mornings. Indeed, it is my Monday morning ritual to start listening to This American Life the instant I wake up; it is the best way for me to start off the week on the right foot! Their typical format is a story in three acts where they follow a general theme and then report on three stories which speak to that theme. . but often in very unexpected ways that will leave you pondering about life, the universe and everything! 7. Revisionist History: Frequency: Weekly / Seasonally | Produced By: Malcolm Gladwell | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherFrom the author that brought us such books as The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers, Revisionist History explores well-known events and retells the tales which have formed modern life. This podcast is especially focused on the details of these events which have been nearly forgotten. This perspective on the “what if” and the “let us not forget that” historical storytelling is both entertaining and educational. Most importantly, you will come away from every episode with greater knowledge of our past and more appreciation that the devil truly is in the details. 8. Without A Path: Frequency: Bi-Weekly | Produced By: Joe Baur | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherFrom adventure-seeker and author Joe Baur, the Without A Path podcast is one of my favorites because it uncovers unique travel stories that are off the well-trodden tourist path. Joe recounts his own travel tales and interviews many other adventures and travel industry professionals. If you have ever dreamed the dream of travel but not yet taken that first step, or if you have already traversed the globe and are seeking the next thrill, Without A Path has a story for you that will get you off the couch and out exploring the world. 9. Posh Corps Podcast: Frequency: Sporadically | Produced By: Alan Toth | Links: Website and iTunesAs a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, I must admit that this podcast speaks to my inner soul in a way that it won’t to those who have not had this shared experience. That said, the stories do take on more of a universal tone than just Peace Corps service and history. The stories are of the human experience and how the those in privileged positions can change the world through acts of kindness and volunteerism. If you are thinking to join the Peace Corps, have been in the Peace Corps, or know anyone who has served, then this is a great place to gain perspective on what it means to serve. 10. Hidden Brain: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: NPR | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherCombining science and storytelling, the Hidden Brian Podcast examines the triggers of human behavior by taking a deep look at biases, trends, research, and storytelling. I find that the lessons uncovered here about the human condition leave me pondering for hours about myself and my own bias. What behaviors do I unknowingly have? What should I change? What shouldn’t I? The answers to all this and much more are what I get out of the Hidden Brain Podcast. 11. The Compass: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: BBC | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherThe world is a big place, full of events and stories which don’t make the cut into the mainstream media. Even when there is broad coverage of a situation, it is too often packaged into a 2-minute snippet. The Compass looks around the globe for circumstances shaping our world which need to be expounded upon. Their reporting is seemingly unbiased with interviews of leaders, locals, and everyone in between. Give The Compass a listen to open your mind to the world and the people in it. 12. True Story: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: Will Rogers | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherPeople do the darndest things! Everyday people like you and I expose their most embarrassing moments, their saddest memories, the inspirations, and the little things in life that bring them joy in this podcast. Storytelling meetups have become a popular trend in the USA and this podcast is about bringing those living room tales out of the shadows and into your ears. You will laugh, you might cry, and you most certainly will learn that it is ok to be a little vulnerable! 13. The Dinner Party Download: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: American Public Media | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherEver go to a dinner party or an event where small talk is not only a skill but also a survival tool? The Dinner Party Download is the best resource for filling your toolbox with interesting factoids, anecdotes, and current events facts which will make you the center of an evening’s conversation. Trust me, listening to this podcast’s mixture of culture, food, and conversation will serve you well! 14. Authority Self Publishing Podcast: Frequency: Weekly | Produced By: Steve Scott and Barrie Davenport | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherAnother podcast for the would-be or veteran writer. If you would like to publish your writing in any medium, or are looking for tools, tips, and inspiration for your next publication, then this podcast is for you. The dual-hosted interview format keeps interviews moving briskly through interesting topics and focuses on helping you be the best self-publisher possible. 15. 1A: Frequency: Daily | Produced By: NPR | Links: Website, iTunes, and StitcherThis is a new podcast from NPR covering daily political and newsworthy events. They pick a theme or just one or two stories, then go deep into a conversation about that theme. The conversation is expertly delivered and I really enjoy listening to 1A. The only warning I would give is that, if me, you are looking for podcasts as an escape from the political conversation in America, then 1A will not help you to that end. However, if you want to deeply expand your knowledge on what is truly going on, then this is a great resource for you. I also recommend listening to their Friday News Roundup, as that weekly episode will give a great rundown of everything that happened during the week. 16. WTF with Marc Maron: Frequency: Twice Weekly | Produced By: Marc Maron | Links: Website and iTunesLooking for some honesty? Well, you found it! Marc Maron has leveraged his legend-status from his comedy career to land some of the most coveted interviewees in modern times. From entertainers to President Barack Obama, it seems like there is no one Marc Maron has not had the opportunity to interview. What makes it even more interesting is that this podcast is produced from his home garage! "

    "title": "Ouro Preto Brazil is the heart of Brazil, Revolution, and an economic explosion",
    "body": "2017/03/08 - Ouro Preto is a small colonial town in the heart of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, near to Belo Horizonte. The entire town was Brazil’s first place to be designated a UNESCO world heritage site, due to its vast historical significance from the early days of Portuguese colonization of Brazil and for its high quality of architectural preservation. Similar to the “go west young man” slogans in America which were inspired by the California Gold Rush, colonial settlers were jumping over each other to get to Ouro Preto first to unearth the rich gold and mineral resource found there. ‘Ouro Preto’ means ‘black gold,’ and it is this gold which spurred an explosion of colonial exploration away from Brazil’s magnificent coastline. In a nutshell: Highlights - Gorgeous scenery and well-preserved colonial architecture. Easily walkable. Lots of nearby waterfalls, trails, and nature activities suitable for all skill levels. Lowlights - Though walkable, the cobblestone streets and numerous hills would make exploration a challenge for anyone with mobility impairments. Bottom line - Ouro Preto is as steeped with as much charm and beauty as it is with historical significance. As one of the best preserved colonial cities in all of Brazil, it should be at the top of your list to visit when looking for a way out of the big cities. A brief history of Ouro Preto: Founded in 1698 in conjunction with the discovery of gold, Ouro Preto’s population exploded to over 100,000 people almost overnight. At one time, it was the largest city in all of the America’s and even dwarfed the then-populations of Rio de Janeiro and New York City. The wealth, power, and size of the city gave way to the first attempt of Brazilian independence from the Portuguese, but this effort proved futile when the Portuguese military crushed the uprising and made a public display of the revolution leader’s head in the town square to discourage any such future revolutionary efforts. However, the ambitions of independence were not washed away so quickly and just 40 years later Brazil won its independence in 1822. The new Brazilian emperor named Ouro Preto as the Imperial City and established many South American firsts here, including the first pharmacy school on the continent. And then the gold ran out: Ouro Preto flourished and led trends across the Americas, but then the gold supply started to dwindle and quickly came to a halt by the end of the 19th century. With the loss of gold resources, Ouro Preto lost its economic engine. Jobs vanished, growth halted, and soon the city became less relevant. The capital of the state of Minas Gerais was then moved to neighboring Belo Horizonte and the title of Imperial City was lost from Ouro Preto forever. The city was forgotten nearly as quickly as it was established. The halt of construction and city expansion did, however, mean that original buildings were left standing and preserved. This is a primary reason for why the city still feels today like it did two centuries ago. In the mid-20th century, the Brazilian government began massive restoration efforts throughout Ouro Preto to encourage the then-blossoming tourism industry there. Today, Ouro Preto is one of the most visited destinations in all of Brazil. Further Reading: Belo Horizonte is a Historic and Cultural Capital of Brazil What to see and do in Ouro Preto: Today Ouro Preto is a smaller town with all the small town charm you could ever dream up. But don’t let the small size fool you! There is plenty to do here, and I argue that it might even have the highest density of attractions in all of Brazil. Here is just a brief outline of my observations. Museums: Many of the colonial government buildings and early manors have been converted into a variety of museums. The Casa dos Contos might have a boring name (tax collection house), but I encourage you not to judge this book by its cover. It has served as a home, a jail, and a hub for revolutionary planning. Its walls are now home to many documents and artifacts from Brazil’s earliest days. If tales of the revolution have your attention, then be sure to check out the Museu da Inconfidência as well. Here you will learn the full story of Brazil’s revolutionary history. If you have studied the American Revolution, you will see many parallels in this history, as it was the American Revolution against the British which most inspired the Ouro Preto revolutionaries to rise up. Considering what made Ouro Preto possible in the first place, you can’t come to know the town without making a visit to the Museu de Mineralogia. This mineral museum is more than just rocks and precious gems. Here you will continue to learn what shaped the hearts and minds of the early Brazilian settlers, and how that made Brazil the beautiful land we have come to know today. There are also a number of art museums: Casa Guignard, Museu de Arte Sacra, Museu Aleijadinho, **and a very interesting church alter museum: Museu do Oratório. ** Everywhere you look in Ouro Preto you will find beauty. I encourage you to stroll down every alley, walk through every door, and keep an open mind and an open heart to what treasures you might find around the next corner.  Churches: Ouro Preto is famous for its churches. Not just for their architectural marvel, but also for their quantity of statues made by Aleijadinho, one of Brazil’s most famous sculptures. Churches are free and open to the public, but please consider a donation wherever you enter, as every drop of coin will go a long way to ensuring the preservation of these beautiful buildings for generations to come. The Igreja da Nossa Senhora do Carmo is located in the main town square next to many museums and historical sites. If you are visiting Ouro Preto, you will have every reason to be directly next to this church and therefore no excuse not to go inside. This rococo-style church was built in 1766 and is home to the last pieces of art made by Aleijadinho. With its unique shape, the Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Rosário was built with slave labor and was the only church in Ouro Preto where slaves were permitted to worship. From its outside appearance, you might think that the Basílica Nossa Senhora do Pilar won’t offer anything which you can’t see at other churches in Ouro Preto, but you would be mistaken! The inside is gilded in gold and silver and is simply breathtaking in every way. The basement of the church houses the Museum of Sacred Art, which does have a small admission fee. Mines: It is easy to think of mines as places worth not exploring when there is so much beauty and activity on the surface of the hills. But don’t forget that it is the mines which make Ouro Preto what it is. These were once the most important mines in the entire world and a visit to one or two of them is the best way to come to understand Ouro Preto. At the top of your list to visit should be the Mina da Passagem. This is the largest mine in the world which offers tours. It is so large that there is even an underground lake, 120 meters below the surface! Be sure to bring a camera, as this is one of the most photogenic places in all of South America. The history here is also quite interesting, as the Portuguese gave the United Kingdom a 100-year lease to this mine in order to pay off imperial debts. Mina do Chico Rei is another of the largest gold mines in the world and is the other most visited mine in Ouro Preto. The mine is named after Chico Rei, or “King Chico,” who was brought to Ouro Preto as a slave from Africa. It is said that King Chico smuggled enough gold out of the mine in his hair to one day not only buy his own freedom but to buy the entire mine! Walking: Ouro Preto is a very walkable town. You will not find yourself getting mowed down by cars on most streets, but do watch out for bikes and motorbikes. The narrow streets and narrow sidewalks don’t offer a lot of room for you and all the other visitors, so just be polite and watch out for each other. Wear sturdy shoes and take breaks as you need them. The old cobblestone streets and walking paths are beautiful but do take a toll on your feet and knees after an active day of walking. There are many hills to walk up and down, so exploring Ouro Preto can be a bit exhausting. There are plenty of places to sit for a coffee or a snack, so take advantage of the local fare whenever you need to take a break. Shopping: Throughout all my travels in Brazil, I found that the handicrafts available in Ouro Preto were of the highest quality, lowest price, and felt the most authentic. There are still many shops with gold and minerals for sale. The prices of these minerals are good, but you should be familiar with precious stones to ensure everything is authentic. Probably the most beautiful pieces are the local handicrafts made of stone. The Soapstone market is down the hill to the east from the Praca Tiradentes. This open-air market is full of local artisans selling beautiful handcrafted soapstone and wood art pieces. I bought an amazing stone chess set here, but had to leave it behind in Brazil as it did not fit in my luggage! I am very sad for that, but I was able to turn it into a great gift for my hosts in Campinas, which made my whole 6-month Brazilian excursion possible. And I can’t feel too bad about that! In the near from Ouro Preto: I made a day trip excursion to the nearby Itacolomi State Park. You will find beautiful flora and fauna here which is easily enjoyable via the vast network of hiking trails. My favorite place in the Itacolomi State Park is a high waterfall with swimming lagoon below. The more adventurous can climb to the top of the falls and jump into the lagoon below. I saw many people do this safely, but I could not muster up the courage myself. Instead, I enjoyed the company of fellow swimmers and encouraged the ones braver than me to provide a good show with their jump. Regardless of your desire to jump, swim, or just relax on the shores, this swimming hole offers a way for everyone to have a good time and to relax. That’s a wrap: Ouro Preto was a major highlight in all of Brazil. I strongly encourage you to check it out if ever you have the opportunity. Have you been there before? Are you planning a trip? I would love to hear from you in the comments below about your Ouro Preto experience or plans! You can also connect with me directly at @JudsonLMoore. Travel safely! "

    "body": "2017/03/03 - Living without a car in America: First Impressions: Are you tired of sitting in traffic every day and wish you could be set free in a place where the city moves you around, rather than sticks you in place? Walkable paths, bikeable streets, and public transit which is as dependable as it is affordable is just one part of what makes great cities great, but a very important element indeed! In addition to promoting physical and mental health, these elements go a long way to making living without a car possible. So where are these centers of car-less freedom? Redfin’s latest report combines Walk, Transit and Bike score data to determine the best cities in the U. S. for living without a car. This top 10 list has both a few obvious destinations, but I must admit, I was a little bit surprised by a few of these. At the top of my surprise, was Minneapolis. Now, to be fair, I have never been to Minneapolis, so it is hard for me to judge. But I have never noticed Minneapolis on a list of cities with great transportation or heard people discussing how great it is to live in Minneapolis. Just goes to show that I might be in a bit of an echo chamber after all. Further reading: Living Without a Car in America In fact, Minneapolis is so bike friendly, that it is the only US city which made a list in 2016 of most bikeable cities worldwide. Despite it only obtaining a #7 ranking on Redfin’s aggregate report, Minneapolis is clearly a great place to be living without a car. The only other surprise I saw on the list was Oakland, which scraped onto the list at #10. I probably should not be surprised by this with the influence of Silicon Valley gentrification. I have many friends living in Oakland, and I know for a fact they all own cars, but they get their fair share of hiking and biking time too. In a place with such amazing weather, you must expect people to be living without a car every chance they get! Redfin’s top 10 list: Without further adieu, here is the start to finish top 10 list of Redfin’s best American cities for living without a car.

    "title": "Enjoy the taste of crow - an interview with Scott Holiday of the Rival Sons",
    "body": "2017/02/21 - Scott Holiday and the Taste of Crow: I caught up with rock band Rival Sons while on tour in Europe to get a sense of life on the road, the creative spirit of the band, and where they are headed next with their music. Guitarist Scott Holiday sat down with me for an interview backstage on February 21, 2017 in Cologne Germany. Scott tells me some hilarious stories from touring with Black Sabbath, and opens up his heart about the pain of being away from family while on the road. But above all, we get some insights for how Rival Sons is teaching that rock how to roll eight years on. How is the tour going? Where are you all at right now?: Scott Holiday: The tour is going great. As far as where we are on the map, we’re in Cologne. We just came from Berlin last night and I think we’re about 2 weeks into this one. We have about 2 more weeks to go before we go home. It’s called the Teatro Fiasco. We decided to do something different than we’ve ever done, different than I’ve ever seen to be honest especially with a rock ‘n roll band, but what we put together with me and our friend, Howie Pyro, who has a radio show at home called Intoxica Radio. And when he does it live, it’s Intoxica Radio Live. He only brings very, very rare 45’s and he spins garage and soul, funk and every—his rule is everything has to make people want to dance, when he does it live, that’s what it is. Howie is of the indie generation and he was in dancing and he’s a legend unto himself. That’s Howie Pyro. He’s great. After this, we bring out our friend Derrick Brown. He’s a published poet at home. He is the owner and president of Write Bloody Publishing, which is a publishing company for poets. It was a really audacious idea that we had to bring this poet out and set the night up like this, but it’s gone over swimmingly. And you can see people being offended. That’s usually my favorite part when people are caught off-guard and the jeers. There are those who come upstage and say like, “I don’t know. I felt—I don’t know if they got it, and I felt the most emotionally connected to those moments. ” That’s what’s supposed to happen. We’re supposed to catch you off-guard. People are supposed to think, “What the fuck is this? Why are they doing this? I don’t know how I feel about this. ” And then you go home with it and you realize a few days later, “Holy shit! I think I really loved that art!” It makes people feel things and that’s the idea. If we don’t spur ourselves and poke ourselves, then our artistic nerves are just becoming complacent and nothing cool about complacency.  Tell us a little bit about your flavor of rock ‘n roll. Where is this coming from?: Scott Holiday: Well, the band is going to be a hybrid of the personalities involved in making it. [We are] very eclectic personalities that like all sorts of music. Mostly, you will probably hear us not listening to rock ‘n roll. We’ve been listening to the newest Anderson Paak record, which is fantastic. We listen to a lot of hip-hop. We listen to a lot of old soul, a lot of funk. I’ve listened the shit out of rock ‘n roll and I still love rock ‘n roll. But our music is an amalgamation of our joys and consciously knowing that we are a rock ‘n roll band. So, yeah, you have a lot of elements that aren’t rock ‘n roll in a rock ‘n roll situation. How do you explain anything like that? And it’s also very traditional and very torch-bearing in a way that we know. Rock ‘n roll has seemed to—I think now it’s just re-sprouting. But when we started the band even before I met the guys when I was looking for everybody, I felt rock ‘n roll had become very complacent with itself and it felt horrible and, of course, it was never going to die or go away, but I just felt like The Blues Brothers being on a mission from God. Further Reading: Posters from Concerts I Promoted We have a responsibility to do it the way that we believe and want to see it done, a dirty rock ‘n roll band. We’ve always said a quote, “It seemed like rock forgot to roll. It’s like rock forgot to dance. ” It forgot its boogie. It forgot what it was all about and I just wanted to make something that I will be proud of and feel like it’s encompassing these elements. It’s dirty. It’s very bluesy. It’s country and western, a lot of R&amp;B, funk and a lot of soul. That’s what rock ‘n roll is. I think the great amalgamation of all these styles. We know what country and western is and we know what the blues is, but rock ‘n roll was a little bit all of those things and our band is a little bit all those things as well. You famously record all of your studio albums on-the-fly, with no preparation or writing prior to entering the studio. Considering the short timespan, how do you get so much creativity into such a short span and still keep up such a high standard of quality of music?: Scott Holiday: I don’t know how to really prepare it. I think it’s just what we are, the animal that we are. The guys in the group were hungry and it takes a long time between records even though we’re doing one every year. We’re playing a lot of live shows all year long. We stay on the road quite a bit and that inspires creation. It also makes you get sick of the old material, not in a way that you’re not going to play well or you don’t want to play it, but in the way that you want new material and you want to expand your catalogue and you want to do new things and you realize—you see your own patterns. You see how you’ve been doing things and where you want to take them. So I think we get inspired that way from playing so much. The key for me is to not finish anything. That sounds lazy but it’s quite the opposite. It’s a hard thing to not finish a song as a writer, but if I leave it open, then I don’t think I’m married to it and then when we get creative together, I’m allowing people to doctor it; add things or subtract things and that’s how we have to create. Otherwise, you get very married to something and then somebody wants to change one little thing and you’re like, “Jesus, what is your fucking problem? Don’t you see the masterpiece I made?” So, I don’t make any masterpieces. I write little bits and then we all work together. It could go horribly wrong. We could have nothing in 3 weeks, but for some reason, it worked out. We also are a big fan of killing our darlings, you know. Nothing is precious. We kill songs constantly in the studio. We write much more than anybody hears and as soon as something feels like it’s got a nail in the tire, we just go move on to something else.  So how did the formation of Rival Sons happen, with such an eclectic group, that everybody said, “Oh, yeah, this makes sense. Let’s do this. ” How do you explain that?: Scott Holiday: I basically gave my mission statement in my pitch one by one to these guys—and each of these guys have their own mission statement on what they want to do with their art and their music—and it just seemed to be we had a common ground that we all wanted to do this rock ‘n roll and we are all connected with each other’s personality to a certain degree. Me and Jay really connected about old blues and how it seems to have been removed from modern rock ‘n roll and that that was a mistake and that’s a travesty. We like to have rock ‘n roll where it was. When we work together, the proof in the pudding is in the taste so that’s really why it worked out. We played together and it just felt like we’re going to do this. There’s no way we weren’t going to do it and it was apparent the first time we played together, it was very strange. You can repel it as much as you want, but it’s like falling in love with a woman. You could say I don’t want to fall in love. I don’t want to meet anybody. But all of a sudden you go to the coffee shop and you’re sitting down with this woman who sits with you and you think, “Holy shit! I think I’m immediately in love with this woman, like there is something cosmic happening. ” So, being in a band is very much like a marriage. Artists are very much like that. It’s a really deep connection. You just feel it with some people and you don’t with others. During your time on the road, do you get homesick? How do you cope with all the time on the road or being away from friends and family?: Scott Holiday: Yeah, I have 2 kids. It’s miserable. It’s horrible. It’s fucking excruciating and it’s no place for a family man on the road. It’s horrible. I already ended a marriage last year because of it. It’s very difficult. My advice about that would be be careful what you wish for. I’ve worked on this since I was a kid and ended up having a family in the interim and it all kind of came to me the way it is now after I had my family and it’s shitty to be away from home. And we all are dads and that is the difficult thing on the road. We love our job and we can’t stop doing the job because the job keeps the family alive and we could not be happy without the job. But it’s the worst part of the job for sure. There’s no bright side. I know this is a dark answer, but it’s the truth. There’s no bright side to it. It sucks. It fucking sucks. We all hate it. But, the kids understand and luckily in this day and age, we have Skype and Facetime. You can only imagine in the ‘60s and ‘70s up until now, those guys didn’t even have cell phones. You had to find a successful landline just to hope to reach them because they’re on the line. It must have been so sad. So, that’s how we cope with it. We talk. I talk to my children every day. I write them every single day. I send them pictures. They send me pictures. We Facetime and we’re still close. They still cry and it doesn’t really satisfy the whole, but it is what it is. I’m sure there’s dads in military families and it kills them too. But you know what, we’re men and this is what how men survive their family, how they like to take care of them. My children understand that. We’re good—we’re all really family-oriented, more than probably any band maybe that you’ve ever met. We’re really, really close like family and we all take care of each other and that’s how you cope too. What advice can you give to anybody starting out on the the rockstar journey?: Scott Holiday: My main advice for people starting out is learn to enjoy the taste of crow. If you wanted to survive and do music for a living, learn to enjoy the taste of crow. It means, learn to enjoy being poor, get comfortable with it because that’s mostly what we are. The happiness isn’t going to come from fame or money. The happiness is going to come from the feeling it gives you, the achievement you make like with the breakthrough with the art, with the expression, with how you’re connected to your instrument or your writing or your painting, your sculpting or your building or whatever. The joy will be from the accomplishment inside of itself, not from the pay. It’s almost weird for the band when you think about it. It’s almost kind of gross, like it’s such a pure thing that I came up with and now I have to deal with lawyers and money about it. Do music because you love it. I know that sounds generic. Do art because you love it. Because you can’t not do it. Because it’s what you’re supposed to do. And enjoy the taste of crow.  Do you have any anecdote you want to share or moment of inspiration, words of wisdom that were passed on to you and you can pass on to others?: Scott Holiday: We toured with Black Sabbath for 13 months and we often shared the same hotels as them. I remember I could hear like 2 doors down from me, it sounded like somebody was listening to the Osbourne TV show too loud on the TV. Sharon and Ozzy were in there and the kids had dropped by too. He was going, “Sharon, turn down the T. V. ” And she’s going, “Ozzy, no!” You can just hear them doing it, like holy shit. They’re right there! I just looked outside the door and thought, “Oh, my God! This is unbelievable. I can’t believe we’re doing this. This tour is going to be great. ” It was just a surreal thing. It all just underscored the importance of authenticity. How has your music evolved over time? Do you get a sense for that evolution day by day? Or do you not really know what it’s going to evolve into until you get in the studio the next time?: Scott Holiday: If I was going into the studio tomorrow, I wouldn’t know until I was in there tomorrow. Even today I couldn’t tell you. There’s several ideas that we all want to pull in and that we talk about that we’re going to pull in, but you’re never really sure how that’s going to manifest when you get in there. We went in there and said, “Yeah, we want this like steady, up-tempoed, groovy record. ” We can get in there and start striking and hitting at that and then immediately go, “This sucks. This sounds like shit right now. It’s like feeling forced and it’s not real. Let’s loosen up and try something else. ” So it’s very organic in that way. It has to be—it’s very honest in that way. You can’t force a record. You can’t bullshit each other and you can’t bullshit the listener. It has to be a real thing for us because, otherwise, it’ll never—it’ll never really come out. That’s for sure. It will never get off, like I said we’re killing our darlings. So, if we’re in there forcing shit, we can hear it real, real quick. We’re looking for the nugget, the magic where we impress ourselves or somebody’s performance is blowing us away. If there’s something forced, we’re likely to delete it. “I don’t fucking want to hear that ever again in my life, delete that right now. ” Is there anything else you want to add?: Scott Holiday: If anybody reading this is a fan, thank you. Thank you, thank you. We’re so thankful that we could come back and do this all over the world and it’s because we have great fans that support us. So thank you.  Thank you, Scott. : A big “thank you” to Scott and the whole Rival Sons crew for taking the time to participate in this interview. So how about you? Do you love the taste of crow?

    "title": "5 Simple Tips to Prepare Your Phone for Travel",
    "body": "2016/10/26 - Phone Travel in a Nutshell: Everyone who travels has a phone. This is a fact of modern life. As accustomed as we are to carrying around these devices in our pockets, even the most frequent flyers can get a little squeamish about switching them on abroad. What is worse: to have no phone access abroad, or to pay through the nose for it? Follow these 5 simple steps to use your phone abroad and spend your money on more interesting things. 1.  Check Your Phone Status: First, make sure the iPhone is unlocked. Most are; Verizon automatically are; you may have to request it from AT&amp;T. You’ll want to make sure it is unlocked before leaving the US. 2. Change Your Settings: Here are the settings to change:  Settings &gt; Cellular &gt; Enable LTE &gt; Data OnlySettings &gt; Cellular &gt; Cellular Data Options &gt; Roaming &gt; Turn off all switches on this pageSettings &gt; Cellular &gt; Personal Hotspot &gt; OffSettings &gt; Cellular &gt; “Use cellular data for:” I default by turning off all apps. Once you get set up, the next time you open an app and you need cell data for that app, it will prompt you to enable. This prevents crappy apps from using background data without you knowing it.  Settings &gt; Cellular &gt; Wi-Fi Assist (very bottom of the settings tab under the other apps) &gt; OffSettings &gt; Cellular &gt; Reset Statistics (so that you can track how much data you are using once you have a new carrier)Settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Ask to Join Networks &gt; On You’ll want to use wifi as much as possible, so turn on the annoying reminder every time your iPhone sees an open wifi network to connect.  Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh &gt; Off (Not related, but a good time to double check that Find My iPhone is enabled, under Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Find My iPhone &gt; On &amp; Send Last Location. Make sure you have the Find My iPhone app installed from the App Store and get your friends to do it as well. You can also go to icloud. com to find it. )  Settings &gt; iMessage &gt; Send &amp; Receive“Start New Conversations From”Choose an email address. That way when you text someone, they will respond to your iMessage only and not accidentally SMS an international number. 3.  Remove the SIM: Once you’re on the plane, remove your SIM card.  You’ll also want a SIM tool just to make life easier, or just use a paperclip.  Keep the SIM card like it’s your passport. You don’t want to get back on US soil and not have service. Seriously, if you lose your passport they’ll still let you back into the country. No SIM card means you have to go to the AT&amp;T or Verizon store. 4. Get A New SIM and a Prepaid Plan: When it comes to getting a SIM card in another country, look for the shadiest place. Definitely don’t get it at the international airport when you land and don’t get it from a retail store of the local cell carrier. Find a hole-in-the-wall shop that is labelled Handy, Mobi, or some other odd way of saying mobile phone. I normally ask for 2 to 5 GB of data and as few minutes of talk time as possible (100 minutes is typical) and prepaid. The plans usually expire, so make sure you only buy enough to use in that period. You can always top-off later on (just go back to any store to top-off; many convenience stores can also do them at checkout). They are less likely to try to upsell you like the carrier’s employees might. However, make them show you the options on a brochure or something; and make sure you get charged an amount that matches that. This is an easy chance for them to charge you an extra 10 euro or whatever, so just act dumb and demand that it matches whatever is on the brochure. Save all the receipts you get, because you’ll probably need them to top-off if you run out of data. Once you get the prepaid plan worked out, they’ll usually offer to install the SIM and activate it. It’s faster for them to deal with the activation text messages which will usually be in the local language with lots of shorthand. Don’t leave the store until you’ve confirmed you can visit a random web site. It’s worth hanging out 5-10 minutes while that happens, rather than having to come back and convince the guy that he messed up and needs to fix it (which he’ll promptly deny). 5. Toggle App Data On/Off: When you need to use an app, if you turned off cell service for everything, it will popup a message directing you to go to settings and turn it back on for that app. You’ll also get alerts if a wifi hotspot is available. Only recommendation is to never turn on cell access for Facebook, which will do it’s best to use a bunch of data in the background when you don’t have the app open. I normally can get by with Google Maps, Safari, and that’s about it. Do you have a preferred phone carrier when abroad? Do you have other tips to share?

    "title": "What is Metasearch And How It Saves You Loads of Time and Money",
    "body": "2016/10/05 - I recently started a new job working at trivago as their B2B spokesperson for the United States. trivago is the world’s largest hotel metasearch, helping travelers find their ideal hotel at the best available rate. Since I started working there, I have found myself thinking many times that most people probably do not know what metadata is, and therefore do not know what is metasearch or why they should care. So let me take a moment to explain what this term means and how these tools can save you loads of time and money. Related Post: 20 Essential Travel Apps Since I am working at trivago, I should mention that this post is not a sponsored post, the content is my own, as are any opinions expressed here. So then, what is this mystical metasearch I speak of? In this modern internet-of-things world it is so cliche to refer to “the Uber of ___” or “the Google of ___. ” As metasearch sites are indeed internet search sites, it might be tempting to refer to them as some nature of “the Google of ___,” but this would be a mistake, unless you said, “the Google of… well… Google!” You see, search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo search the internet’s content. Metasearch engines search the data from search engines. Simply put, metasearch allows you to search across multiple search sites simultaneously. In the following, I will explain a bit about how metasearch works. I will focus on travel metasearch sites, and I will show you how these sites save you loads of time and money. Metadata Explained: Metadata is all of the behind the scenes data which make the Internet the Internet. Metadata can be the snippet of code which identifies the location of an image file on a server, the description of a link, or the price of a service. You may have seen this before if ever you have received an email which has images, but your mail client does not display the images automatically. Maybe there is just an empty image placeholder box and a small bit of text describing what that image is. This description text tells search engines what that photo is of, and also helps users who are visually impaired have a better internet experience by giving the photo a description which can be read out loud by software to those users. Please forgive the nerd in me that despite my best judgement will now show you a really boring (but instructive) workflow chart.  source: Jakob Voss In the chart above, you can see that all of the world’s information exists on many servers. This network is called the World Wide Web. Search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo, untangle this web by indexing, or pre-searching, all of the web’s content and making it easy to find. Metasearch tools index these search engine results and helps users find the best results from each service all at one time. As I will describe next, this becomes really helpful when shopping for travel online. Metasearch Travel Sites:       Let’s say for example that you want to book a flight, because let’s face it, you DO want to book a flight, right? To book a flight, you can go to the booking sites of every airline and look for schedules and prices, but this would take you a very long time and undoubtedly leave you without a comprehensive overview of all the options available. The better tool to use in this case is a metasearch which specializes in flights, like Skyscanner (iOS   Android). Skyscanner searches more than 1,200 airline and travel sites all with one click! They display to you the cheapest flights available which match your search, and then pair you with the best deals on the internet. Thus, saving you loads for time and money on your flight purchase.          trivago (iOS   Android) operates in a similar fashion but is focused solely on hotels. trivago searches more than 250 hotel booking sites around the world and instantly shows travelers the best available rates for properties which best meet their needs. A quick search on trivago will show you that the same room on the same night will have a variety of prices depending on which site you book that room with. trivago empowers travelers to quickly search the whole internet to find their ideal room and book it at the very best rate.    Hospitality. net reported that before metasearch sites became prevalent, the savvy traveler was searching as many as 22 bookings sites before making a purchase. As you can see, metasearch  saves you loads of time and money.   Metasearch Sites By Industry: Here are some examples of travel metasearch sites as well as a few which are not metasearch sites. I have categorized them by the travel sectors with which they work. Metasearch for hotels:    AllTheRooms     Google Hotels (now just a Google search)     Kayak     Qunar     TripAdvisor                 trivago (iOS     Android)          Metasearch for flights:    Google Flights     Kayak     Qunar     Skyscanner     TripAdvisor  Not metasearch:    Booking. com     Expedia. com     Hilton. com     Hotels. com  In Closing: Do you use any of the metasearch tools I mentioned here? Other metasearch site or apps? Do you find them useful, or do you find them to be an unnecessary extra layer of the internet? Please let me know your thoughts in the comments below, or you can reach me directly at @JudsonLMoore. featured photo credit Tim Gouw. "

    "title": "You Must Write A Book! A Review Of Honorée Corder's Latest Inspiration",
    "body": "2016/10/03 - What To Expect From Honorée Corder’s Latest: Spoiler Alert! YOU can write a book, and with Honorée Corder’s most recent book, you will not only learn how to write a book, but you will also be inspired to put pen to paper.  You Must Write A Book is the fastest book I have ever read, finishing it in just two settings. I walked away smarter, inspired, and empowered. Give this book a read, and even if you’ve never considered the notion, you might just find yourself writing a book! In A Nutshell: Highlights - Covers every aspect of what it means to write a book: ideation, structuring, planning, publishing, promoting, and more. Details are as deep as they are wide, while still being an easy book to digest. Many additional online resources are provided to the reader. Lowlights - Crafting the reader journey via a comprehensive story-arch is not covered in-depth. Outlining techniques are well explained but the creative component is lacking. Bottom Line - You should read the rest of my post, but feel free to do it after you buy the book. It is just that good! If you have ever considered writing a book on any topic but don’t know where to start or even how to finish, then You Must Write A Book, by Honorée Corder is a must-read. Summary of You Must Write A Book: In Honorée Corder’s 20th book, she has done something truly remarkable: she is sharing her magic-sauce. As a veteran author and business coach, she has a lot to offer to all of us. She is not your typical Harvard-to-Wall Street-to-Author kind of author. No, Honorée is a real person, with a real family, and a real life grounded in typical challenges and successes like what we all have. How do I know? Because she is also my writing coach! And if you’re reading this, then in a way, you’re also reading a part of Honorée. Her methods, process, and encouragement have done great things for me, and after you’ve read You Must Write A Book, then great things will happen for you too! Topics Covered In-Depth: Honorée outlines her start-to-finish writing process, including: Why writing a book is good for your business. Why a book is better than a business card. Who can write a book (hint: it’s you!)Crafting an Idea and outline. Self Publishing. Building a Launch plan. Maximizing the value of your book. I particularly enjoyed the depths she went into describing the very basic mathematics of writing a book. A book is impressive because it is long. It is easy for one to think that you can not write a book because you don’t have so much to say. But how many emails have you written today? Facebook messages? Oh, you have things to say alright, and with a little planning, you can construct those thoughts into a beautiful and interesting book. Two key elements that Honorée covers thoroughly is how to set a daily writing goal, and realizing that consistent efforts add up quickly. After you read this book, you will realize that by following some very basic steps, then before long, you too can own the esteemed title of ‘author. ’  “Oh my goodness, that email had 764 words in it and I had writer’s block and it took me three weeks to write it!” said no one, ever. - Honorée_ Corder_ My Personal Takeaway: A central theme in my own writing and in this blog is the concept of ‘showing up. ’ Most people never show up and give themselves the opportunity to succeed, and therefore they are stuck in a negative feedback loop of always wondering “what if” and “why not me?” However, what this book did for me was to remind me that my own life philosophies should be applied to the challenge of writing a book. Honorée says many times that being a genius, having 40 years experience, or being a literary mastermind, is no prerequisite for writing a book. The fact is that MY story and MY voice are different from anyone else’s and will resonate with people in a way that no one else’s voice will. This is both a great reminder and great encouragement to write a book. Will You Accept the Challenge?: Now it is your turn! What will you do? Will you read this book? Will you write your own book? Buying it now on Amazon is the first step. I would LOVE to discuss this book and your writing with you further. Please leave me a comment below, or contact me directly at @JudsonLMoore. Spoiler Alert #2: I am writing a book! Look for it later this year. To be alerted of all my updates and when my book is published, subscribe to my newsletter now.

    "title": "The Iguazu Falls Are More Than The World's Largest Waterfall System",
    "body": "2016/09/17 - Iguazu Falls Recap: My journey to the Iguazu Falls is woven with the most thrilling story I have to tell. The majestic landscape of the Falls is nearly indescribable. I will do my best here to not only describe the experience I had, but to also convince you to make a visit as soon as possible. The story I will tell is one of a desperate, young (clueless), American backpacker and the most beautiful place with a surprise lurking around every corner. Buckle up, this ride is going to get a little bumpy! In A Nutshell: Highlights - The Iguazu Falls Park is clean, well-organized, affordable, and unbelievably breathtaking. The border crossings between Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay give stamps and you can be in all three countries in one day. Lowlights - Unless you fly to here, you will spend a really long time on a bus or driving. This is way off the beaten path. Also, be careful of those you encounter on the street and officials at the border crossing. Bottom Line - This is a must visit destination. Just be vigilant in exercising all your traveling best-practices and everything will be great. If you can, stay overnight at the resort inside of the Iguazu Falls Park on the Argentinian side. Why I Chose To Visit The Iguazu Falls: My visit to the Iguazu Falls came on the 89th day after I arrived in Brazil. Why on this day? Tourist visa rules, that’s why! My plan was to take a quick day trip in to Argentina to see that side of the Iguazu Falls and then come back to Brazil to continue the rest of my 6-month journey around the country. I somehow did not know what to expect about the Iguazu Falls, just that I had received many recommendations to go there. Ultimately, I did make the trip due to this visa situation. After a 10-hour overnight bus ride from Santa Fé, where I first saw the Milky Way Galaxy, I am rested and ready to experience the next grand natural wonder. What is coming at me in the following hours is a story that shapes the rest of my life.  Iguazu Falls flowing over green outcrop Upon Arrival to the Iguazu Falls: Because I arrived and departed in the early morning and evening darkness, it took me a long time to realize that Foz do Iguazu is actually a fairly substantial city. You can easily spend a few days here enjoying nature and hopping across the Friendship Bridge into Paraguay to do some shopping. However, since I just knew to see the waterfalls, that is pretty much all I did. Even this made the time and effort well worth it. Upon arrival to the bus station, I went to Argentina directly with a taxi. The trip is both fast and cheap. The taxi drivers were all very nice and quite a bit more laissez faire than in other places I have been (I am looking at you, India and Kyrgyzstan!) A short while later, I smoothly passed through the Argentinian boarder and had new stamps in my passport (this foreshadows what happens later). The day was a bit rainy and I was visiting in the off-season, so I felt like I had the park to myself. The entry free is scaled depending on what all you want to do during your stay. I opted for free range access to the park’s vast trails, the Falls observatory, and a boat ride under the Falls. Everything was extrodenarially cheap, except for the boat ride, but hey, I have come this far, so I may as well do all the things! Iguazu Falls Panorama A Walk Through The Rain Forest: My visit to the Iguazu Falls was unsurprisingly focused on seeing water falling down the side of cliffs. I had just spent a few months in the more northern and tropical parts of Brazil, so on this particularly rainy day I didn’t expect much more than to interact with water. Then I found the Iguazu rain forest trails. There are a number of trails winding through the Iguazu Falls Park which are meticulously manicured and often elevated. Anyone with limited mobility will also be able to enjoy these trails as most of them have no stairs. Without warning, something amazing swooped right in front of me: a toucan! I look up and to my astonishment, there is a whole flock of toucans and a variety of other exotic birds in every shape, size, and color. Some are flying and others are perched on the equally exotic flora of the Iguazu Falls Park. I have never seen such birds even in captivity, so to see so many flourishing in the wild up close has continued to be a life highlight even years later.  A Toucan at Iguazu Falls Park You could spend days in the Iguazu Falls Park exploring these amazing trails and sights. Each one can be completed in 1-2 hours, so if you have to choose just one, I recommend the Devil’s Throat Trail. This is one of the longer trails, but you also get spectacular views of the Falls while also weaving in and out of the forest. From these vantage points above the Falls, you sense their vastness. The Iguazu Falls are like the Grand Canyon, just wetter! Observation Deck at the Iguazu Falls The official tourism website for the Argentinian side of the Iguazu Falls has great information about all the trails in the Park. Just visit their website and select one of the trails from the main menu. At the bottom of each of those pages is an awesome interactive map like this one. This map is for the Devil’s Throat Trail. Going Off-Road and Off-Land to the Iguazu Falls: Now on to the main event! Though you can walk down to water’s edge below the Iguazu Falls, I needed to rest after the hiking. I opted to take the 4X4 off road excursion tour down to the boat docks. It is a short drive, but really cool and I do recommend it. Once at the docks, you can hear the Iguazu Falls and see some mist bellowing from around the distant corner, but you can not see the waterfalls directly. We receive a boat safety briefing, put on life jackets, load up, and off we go. The boat reminds me a bit of the rubber rafts you see the Navy SEALS using in the movies, but it bigger than that and plenty substantial enough for these waters. We speed up the river toward the Iguazu Falls, which come more and more into view as we get closer and round the bend. The way that the Iguazu Falls come in to view is spectacular. Just as you think you must be seeing the whole thing, you are proven wrong as the view of this seemingly endless waterfall system becomes less obscured. The boat came fairly close to the water, close enough for me to feel the choppiness of the water below and for to become quite wet as well. We were provided with ponchos, so the wetness was not too extreme. We made a few passes by the waterfalls, each time approaching from a different angle providing very different views. The whole boat tour lasts about 30 minutes. Though this is not so much time, it is enough to make the costs worth it and to provide truly amazing memories of the Iguazu Falls.  Iguazu Falls view from below Dinner, And Then One More Adventure: After this exhausting day of hiking, boating, and getting a bit wet, I satisfied my extreme hunger by devouring a steak at the Sheraton Resort which is inside the Argentinian side of the Iguazu Falls Park. I wish I had the money to get a room there, but just dinner was breaking the bank! It looked like a magnificent place to stay, and the steak is one of the best I have ever had. One Last Adventure: Now I was out of money, out of energy, and out of time. I had a bus to catch back across the border and I needed to get going or be stranded without a place to stay. I easily caught a cab from the Iguazu Park entrance and as the sunset behind me, I arrived back to the border. Remember at the top of this post when I said I got my passport stamps? I had received an exit stamp from Brazil and an entry Stamp in to Argentina. The border guard booths are separated by about half a mile, between which you can only drive in one direction. As I departed from Argentina, I was passed on to the Brazilian side without any issue, but upon arriving to the Brazilian booth was told that I had no exit stamp from Argentina. It was true, the Argentinian booth did not give me an exit stamp. Therefor, the Brazilian guard refused to give me entry to Brazil! I said I would go back and get the stamp but was told it was a one-way road and I was not allowed. Where were in a standoff. After quite some time of debating and arguing the point, the Brazilian official allowed me back into Brazil, but did not give me a stamp. So now, according to my documents, I was illegally in the country. Great. Years later, I realize that this was likely a scam to get bribe money. I didn’t get that at the time, nor did I have any money to give anyway. Despite this hiccup, I made it to my bus just on time and soundly slept until arriving to my next destination. Furthermore, though at the time this passport stamp issue instilled some degree of panic and stress in me, I now realize that this sort of thing simply happens in certain parts of the world, and that the best thing to do is remain calm, stick by your morals, and follow the law. Don’t pay bribes, and if you have to, play stupid. I was stupid, and that helped!

    "body": "2016/09/08 - A Weekend In The German Wine Country: After a short 3 hour drive south on the German Autobahn from Düsseldorf, just past Frankfurt, I found myself standing in a rolling green field of my favorite plant: the Vitis! More commonly known as grapevines! Yes, I am in Landau, the heart of German Wine Country. I am here this weekend with some friends to do some wine tasting at the Weingut Pfirmann (on Facebook).  The winery is a small, 4th generation family-owned and operated establishment with chic style on every inch of the bottle, the equipment, and the tasting room. If you are able to make a trip to Landau I recommend staying at the Heiligenthaler Hof Apartments and Rooms which are super nice and come at a very low price tag. Even better, the restaurant here is Greek and some of the best food I’ve ever eaten. All the staff were super friendly and treated us like family, even giving us a few rounds of ouzo when we helped them fix their lights. If you are planning a trip to Landau or have been here before, please let me know about it by leaving a comment below or by reaching me directly at @JudsonLMoore. Weingut Pfirmann Taste Testing: From our hotel to the winery was a nice 5km walk through rolling hills of the vineyard. We decided to walk because the weather was spectacular and the countryside is truly something out of the movies. We took our time, snapping some photos along the way, but within an hour we arrived at Weingut Pfirmann. Upon arrival, we were cheerfully greeted by the owner and wine master, who didn’t waste a second to get a chilled glass of their Secco Rosé into our hands. After the warm walk, it was a welcomed start to the afternoon festivities. Spoiler alert: this was my favorite wine of the day, but I can’t say it didn’t get bonus points for excellent timing! After a brief tour of the facilities and a crash course of the winemaking process, we moved into the tasting room and the main event got underway.  photo credit: Kathrin Rupprath Weingut Pfirmann Wine List and Impressions: Now, I have to admit, I took notes on my thoughts for each wine, but aside from having a wrecked pallet long before I got to the 11th bottle, I also just don’t have the vocabulary for properly describing wines. Therefore, I have merged my personal thoughts with some descriptions I found on EuroWineKontor to help me out. You can also buy the wine online from that site. Download the entire Weingut Pfirmann 2016 wine list [here (PDF)” file=”. . /assets/images/2016/09/weingut-pfirmann-weinliste. pdf). * denotes my top picks    SECCO, Secco Rosé, 11. 5% VOL* - …     2015 Landschneckenkalk Riesling, 13% VOL - Nose of ripe peach, citrus fruits, and fresh herbs. On the tongue, limestone, minerals, and hints of green apple.     2015 Buntsandstein Riesling, 12. 5% VOL - Nose of red apple, vineyard peach, apricot, mango, grapefruit and red currant. Palate: very precise, elegant, juicy with a crisp freshness and a slightly earthy flavor.     2015 Sauvignon Blanc, 13% VOL - The bouquet smells very clear of fresh herbs, some gooseberry, and hints of nuts. On the palate is a delicious fruit with a crisp acidity and a nice minerality that give a great vitality.     2015 Grauer Burgunder, 13% VOL* - In the nose and palate first falls a delicate fruity aroma of white stone, and then turns to a peach and apricot accent.     2015 Kalkmergel Grauer Burgunder, 13. 5% VOL* - Flavors of stone fruit as a fresh peach, plum, apricot, a nice flavor and very fine nuances of nuts.     2015 Kalkgestein Chardonnay, 13. 5% VOL - Fruity, buttery, with a velvety feel that’s atypical of dry white wines.     2015 Gewürztraminer, 13% VOL - Smells very aromatic and spicy with ripe grapes, roses, exotic fruits and a hint of cinnamon. On the palate, very full, vigorous, with a certain force. Intensely aromatic.     2015 Rieslaner Auslese, 7. 5% VOL* - …     2015 Rosé, 12% VOL* - On the nose aromas of strawberries, but also notes of peach and passion fruit. Palate has a crisp freshness with a lively acidity component, but well balanced. In addition, little by little notes of sweet cherries, and peaches return at the end.     2012 Cabernet-Merlot dry, 14% VOL - Full-bodied with herbal notes. Fruity, spicy. Very soft, less tannic than Cabernet Sauvignon.  [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”5249,5250,5251,5300”] The Walk Back To Town: It is hard to say that there was a part of this day’s experience which was better than the wine. However, the walk home was what the day was really about. We spent hours soaking in the German wine country by wandering through the vineyards and rolling hills. Time with friends, enjoying the evening air, and a beautiful sunset, this is what makes life rich and memories grand. I highly recommend that you make a visit to the German wine country and to Landau. Take your family, your friends, or just yourself. You are going to have a great time! Have you been to Landau before? Are you thinking about making a trip there? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below, or reach out to me directly at @JudsonLMoore.  "

    "title": "Lost or Stolen Passport? Stay Calm and Follow These Instructions.",
    "body": "2016/08/25 - You’re planning your next adventure, or perhaps you are out somewhere in the world discovering new sights, smells, and sounds. Then you come to a panicked realization: I have lost my passport! Yes, this is bad news. But do not panic! This happens all the time and there are clear guidelines for how to replace your lost or stolen passport. Contact The Authorities Immediately: First and foremost, you must contact the passport issuing authorities that issued your passport. In the United States, that is the State Department. In other countries, it will be your respective Foreign Ministry. I have thankfully never misplaced my passport, but in response to a comment left by another reader of this blog, I thought that the topic was one well worth researching. I will explain below some common FAQs I found on various countries’ foreign ministry sites which explain in authoritative detail what to do if your passport has been lost or stolen, however, as I am no legal authority, I direct you to read those sites directly. You can find a number of links at the bottom of this post. In general, these instructions will depend on one of two statuses: are you currently in the country that issued the passport, or are you abroad? If you are at home, you will contact the passport issuing authority directly. If you are abroad, you will contact your closest embassy or consulate. Gather Some Documents: After contacting your passport issuing authority, the next step in replacing your lost or stolen passport is to prove your identity. You are going to need some documents for this, so I hope you have kept good records. Perhaps you have shared copies of all your vital documents with a close friend or family member, as I have advised in my post, 8 Things To Tell Your Family Before You Travel. Here are the documents you will most likely need:    A new passport photo     Identification (driver’s license, expired passport etc. )     Evidence of citizenship (birth certificate, photocopy of your missing passport)     Travel Itinerary (airline/train tickets) (only if abroad or if needing to expedite)     Police Report (if stolen)     A new passport application     An official statement (usually an official form) stating your passport was lost or stolen  How Long Does It Take To Replace My Passport?: This depends greatly on a number of factors. Under most circumstances, you can get your lost or stolen passport replaced within a matter of days, if truly necessary. You must typically pay a premium price for this service, go in-person to your passport issuing authority, and you might have to prove your urgency by demonstrating that you have travel arrangements coming in just a few days or some sort of emergency for which you must travel. If you are in the fortunate position to have a little time before you cross a border again, then you can take the normal passport application route and get your passport in the typical time frame; usually a few weeks. How Much Does It Cost To Replace My Passport?: The cost of replacing a lost or stolen passport varies drastically by circumstance and by nationality. If you need your passport replaced quickly, it will cost more. If you have been the victim of a crime, are truly unable to pay, or are having a life-or-death emergency, it is possible to have all fees waived. Again, consult your nearest embassy or the passport issuing authority at home to determine if you might qualify for a price reduction. What Is The Status Of My New Passport?: Sometimes a new passport might be issued as a temporary passport which is only valid for a short period of time while you wrap up your current or pending travel. This seems to be fairly rare, however, so you should expect that your brand new passport will be valid for the full length of any new passport unless told otherwise. In the United States, passports are valid for 10 years. Asking what type of travel document will be issued to you as a replacement for your lost or stolen passport is something you should clarify early in the replacement process.  Here are the links to the appropriate authorities in a few countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union. For other countries, just click here for a Google search.

    "title": "Three Ways Travel Changed My Life When I Was Young",
    "body": "2016/08/09 -  I am thrilled to have my father, Bob Moore, be the first guest author on my blog! The following is an account of how travel changed his life at an early age. Maybe this is where I got it from? It’s a beautiful story, with a great lesson to each each of us. I hope you enjoy it and that you will leave a comment below. You can also reach me directly at @judsonlmoore. Three Ways Travel Changed My Life:  Travel changed my college major and career aspirations.  Travel enabled me to overcome recalcitrant racist feelings.  Travel precipitated a break-up with the girl I thought I would marry. When I was 21 years old, I had an opportunity to spend ten weeks doing service work on a Caribbean island. It was a genuine island paradise, with wonderful beaches, rain forest mountains, and exotic people. Having been raised in the rural South of the United States, I had traveled little, and never internationally. Over the weeks I worked there my eyes were opened to a new reality. I spent most of my time in remote, rural villages. I slowly became able to see, for the first time, how culture and social structure determined the life chances of the people who lived there. The effect was profound. When I came to the island, I was majoring in the hard sciences and mathematics. When I was left, I was determined to study as much anthropology and sociology as I could manage. Thus I crammed a four-year education into five years. I entered a career where I would teach and conduct research on how to change culture and social structure to improve the life chances for poor and marginalized people in my own country. The cross-cultural experience continues to inform my thoughts and values to this day. As a son of the rural South, I was raised to be a racist. By the time I was in the eighth grade, I was getting an inkling that this was wrong. By the time I entered college, I was committed to purging myself of racist thinking. My feelings were another matter. The place I grew up was as segregated as ever. I had almost no experience with black people, no black friends. A young woman named Percilyn changed that. She was a beauty of mixed race, my age, single. I walked her home from church on a romantic tropical evening. With her mother’s permission, we sat on the porch swing and talked. She smelled wonderful. I touched her “kinky” hair, and found it incredibly, unexpectedly soft. We kissed. That kiss broke the log jam that prevented my feelings from keeping up with my thoughts about race. I was freed to admire and celebrate people who were not like me. For that I have been forever afterward grateful to Percilyn, and have never forgotten her. I was in her small town for only ten days. Our “romance” included a friendship, conversation, a walk in the tropical moonlight, and one kiss. And that has made all the difference. The kiss with Percilyn notwithstanding, I had left a girl behind in the States. We corresponded continuously. We had had a wonderful teen courtship for six years; nobody died, and nobody got pregnant. By our community standards, that was a successful romance. I loved her and expected to marry her when we completed college. When I returned to the USA, I experienced reverse culture shock. It was as though my home was now the exotic country. I was very happy to be reunited with my love and we spent many hours catching up on our respective summer adventures. As the months passed, however, an unwanted and unexpected unease began to force itself into my consciousness. I was no longer the boy she had fallen in love with in our early teens. I intuited that she was becoming aware of this, too. Early the next year, we tearfully broke up, each with a bruised if not broken heart. The happy ending is that within three years both of us had met and married two wonderful people, and before long were producing children of our own. Our marriages, not to each other, have both been richer, more satisfying than either of us could have imagined as teens. I’m very happy for both of us. Travel can change your life as it changed mine. I’m glad I did it while I was young. "

    "title": "Tips For Overcoming Language Barriers",
    "body": "2016/08/01 - There is no such thing as an “easy Language” to learn. After all, a language is an inherently huge thing. That said, there are a lot of things you can do to quickly overcome language barriers and rapidly ascend to fluency. Common Tricks for Overcoming Language Barriers:       There are some simple self-study activities most people try when studying a language. Flashcards are easy to make and are a great way to study vocabulary by yourself or with a friend. I use sticky notes to label everything at home with its definition in the language I am studying. Devices like your cell phone, computer, and TV have language settings which you can configure to give you that next level of exposure. Taking a group or individual lesson is also fantastic but can be very expensive, which is why I usually utilize eLearning apps. My favorite eLearning app for language is Duolingo (iOS   Android).    If you are already in the country where the new language is spoken, you will find yourself automatically acting out a real-world game of Charades. This can help you get what you need right now, and people might tell you the word to stuff you point at, but it is difficult to remember words you are told in the heat of the moment. That is why I came up with this list of tips and tricks I use to overcome language barriers around the world. Write It Down: Keep a notebook nearby or use a notes app on your mobile device. Every time you hear or read a word that you want to learn, write it down to a list that you can come back to later. Also write down English words that you think you should prioritize learning in the new language so that when you are studying later you already have a pool of practical words for you to start with. You will be amazed at how many times a day you contribute to this list and and you will be very thankful that you have it later on. Read Everything: Reading is very critical in learning. When I say to, “read everything,” I am not talking just about books and printed material. You will find a lot of learning can be done while walking down the street, sitting on a train, or watching TV with captions. Make an effort to read every sign, headline, and bold word that stands out from the crowd. Though you might not understand everything you read today, you are working to build a vocabulary which will make more sense tomorrow when you pair those words with a meaning. This is useful regardless of the language you are studying. If you are studying a language which uses a different written alphabet than your own, this makes great practice for stringing together all the sounds that go with the new alphabet you are learning. Vocabulary memorization can be very tiresome and headache-inducing, but when you use this approach, you will see that it is fun to learn the words which you see around you every day. Search for Cognates (but beware!): Many languages share common words which can give you a head start communicating with others. When I lived in Kyrgyzstan, I joked that every item invented since the pencil was a cognate from English. As an example, here is a list of 1001 Spanish words you may already know. Impressive right? You already speak survival Spanish without any effort! Beware of false cognates. These are words which sound like a word in your language, but which has a different meaning in the other language. Here are a couple of funny false cognates in French. Listen… Uncomfortably: Learning a language is a great time to practice your active listening skills. You can listen to the radio, TV, podcasts, other people, and any number of other sources. I recently moved to Germany and one of the most important things for me is to spend time with my German friends. If we are in a group, I strongly discourage them from speaking English. Sometimes they start speaking about things with which I have no context, poor vocabulary, or I can’t keep up with the speed. In these times, I just quietly sit back and try to hang on for the ride as best I can. It can get uncomfortable when conversations go on for a long time without being able to keep up, but this is still valuable exposure. Just like reading every sign in the street, listening may not always feel like much now, but these spoken words will absolutely pile up in your unconscious vocabulary and will be easier to recall later when you learn their meaning. Bonus skill: listening also improves your understanding of proper pronunciation! Butcher the Grammar: Do not let the complexities of grammar keep you from making an effort. Use the best grammar you can, but at the end of the day, just put the words down and speak them out loud. People will often understand what you mean and hopefully, from time to time they will also correct you and help you understand the most proper way. I make plenty of grammar mistakes that no one cares about, and other mistakes that people find hilarious. Don’t take offense to any laughter. Just remember, they are laughing with you, not at you. Another helpful tactic is to learn shortcuts. For example, In German, there are three articles for nouns (der, die, das) which correspond to the gender of the noun. Remembering which one to use with every word is way too hard and time-consuming, so I basically just use “der” for everything singular, and “die” for everything plural. It is correct often enough, and when wrong, everyone knows what I am getting at, which is all that matters. Have Fun!: Regardless of why you are learning a language, fun must be part of it. Try not to take yourself too seriously while getting accustomed to this new challenge. With time, you will be telling jokes, laughing with others, and soon be everyone’s favorite person to bring to dinner and show off the foreigner’s funny speaking skills!

    "title": "Travel Advice To Rajasthan India",
    "body": "2016/03/28 - Rajasthan India is one of the most sought after destinations in the world. This dusty desert plain is a throwback to a more magical time when sultans ruled and where the unbelievable power of mystics can still be felt today. Related Post: India Travel Advice In Under 10 Minutes I traveled to three places in Rajasthan: Jaipur, Ajmer and Pushkar. I tell my story here. If you have a story to share, please drop me a line in the comments section below. Jaipur, Rajasthan: The Pink City, as Jaipur is known, is called as such because all the buildings here are painted a reddish pinkish color to imitate the red sandstone architecture of Mughal cities, from which Jaipur is fashioned. This western point of the famous Golden Triangle of India sits in the heart of Rajasthan and is the route that connects Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, so that should tell you something about how important of a place this is.  Jaipur is the largest city in Rajasthan. Many of India’s most infamous landmarks reside in Jaipur. The most glorious of these is the Amber Fort. To enter the fort, one must ride an elephant up the mountainside at a price steeper than the mountain its self, but it is well worth the 10-minute experience. While ascending to the fort, I dropped my sunglass case on the road far below me, but not to worry, the next elephant picked it up and handed it to me! After a short Purell bath, the case was as good as new. Once inside the Amber Fort, we were overwhelmed by the architecture and detail work. Between the geometric gardens, facades with incredibly preserved details and surviving paintings of the Kama Sutra, the space was a lot to take in. All of that was small potatoes compared to the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace). The Mirror Palace is a space within the Amber Fort, which is covered in tiny convex-shaped mirrors. The light reflecting off of all the surfaces shifts as you walk through the space and the feeling is very dazzling. We spent a few hours at the fort and then moved along to explore the rest of Jaipur. Directly across from our hotel is the Jal Mahal (Water Palace). This palace is a manmade island and structure for which the original purpose wasn’t explained (to me), but which is now closed to the public and slated for renovation as a fine dining establishment. This 5-story structure of Rajput and Mughal styles will be a grand place to dine, but the high level of pollution in the lake will make it challenging to maintain an appetite; the foam at water’s edge was literally seafoam green. Since we couldn’t go out to the Jal Mahal, we just took a few photos and then went into the heart of Jaipur’s old town. The second most architecturally impressive structure in Jaipur is called Hawa Mahal (Wind Palace). Aside from the stunning wedding-cake layered details of the building, it is special because of the abundance of windows, many of them only the size of a head. These windows were viewing portals for the royal family to look out on the city and people as they would gather around the front of the City Palace. With the windows open, the whole building is filled with a breeze that makes the desert’s summer temperatures more suitable for royalty. Behind the Hawa Mahal stands City Palace, the old capital of the Rajasthan State and seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. Much of the palace is open to the public but it is still an active royal residence, so the residential chambers are off-limits. However, you can buy a $100 ticket that will allow you to walk through the living quarters of the current Maharaja. Imagine paying $100 to walk through the Queen’s apartment at Buckingham Palace! The City Palace is home to some pretty interesting architecture, paintings, and artifacts, including the Ganges-water urns: the two largest sterling silver objects int he world. The purpose of these vessels was to carry water from the Ganges River from India to England for the 1901 coronation of King Edward VII so that the Maharaja of that time would not have to drink the English water. The vessels are 1. 6 meters (5. 2 ft) height and each have a capacity of 4000 liters. They weigh 340 kilograms (750 lb) and are made from 14,000 melted silver coins. One art piece that I thought was striking was a number of rifles and spears that were laid out in a large circle. The guns are pointing in toward the center while the spears are pointed out toward the edge. The guide said that it was to symbolize Indian strength and wealth, but I think it symbolizes the imperial occupation of Britain who had a superior military versus the Indians who had less advanced weaponry. Ajmer, Rajasthan: My first train ride in India led me to Ajmer, a small town in the heart of Rajasthan.  Ajmer is a small town of only 500,000 people (which is a small town in these parts). The town was easily walkable, which is what we opted to do for the mile journey to Daulat Bagh, a park on Lake Ana Sagar. In the park, we came across an interesting temple to Lord Shiva. I would later learn that king cobra snakes are present in all of Lord Shiva’s temples, but in Rajasthan they seem to be much more prominent. Despite this, I only came across one real king cobra snake on my journey and I was more afraid of its charmer than I was the snake its self. After the temple, we continued on to Lake Ana Sagar, a 900-year old man made lake. The prominent feature about this lake is a 5-pavilion marble structure known as Baradari. It’s expanse of white marble overlooking the lake is beautiful; no wonder the tourists flourish to this site. We only had a few hours to spend in Ajmer, so after finding a quick coffee we hailed a cab and moved on to the nearby town of Pushkar where we embarked on an overnight camel safari. Pushkar - Religious Center of Rajasthan: Pushkar is one of the most significant pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, created Pushkar. Despite the significance of Lord Brahma, there are very few temples in the world are dedicated to him, thanks to the Curse of Savitri. The Pushkar temple is, however, the most significant of the Brahma temples and viewed by many as the only legitimate temple. Pushkar is widely considered to be one of the most religious places in the world. As legend has it, Lord Brahma killed the demon Vajranabha while it was attempting to murder his children. Lord Brahma’s weapon is the lotus flower. Upon striking the demon Vajranabha, three petals of the lotus flower fell to the Earth and created three lakes, including the lake at the center of Pushkar, which would later be visited by Lord Brahma himself. During his visit, he married a consort who was not his wife, Savatri. When Savatri learned of this marriage, she cursed Lord Brahma such that he would never be worshiped except for in Pushkar. It is because of this act that the Pushkar temple is considered to be the only temple that can be or should be dedicated to Lord Brahma. The lake which Lord Brahma’s lotus flower petals formed in Pushkar is the other majorly significant site to see in Pushkar. I was told that the name of the lake is “Moon Lake,” but I’ve not been able to find any reference to that name online; most places just call it the “Pushkar Lake. ” A dip in this lake is to Hindus of similar significance what a submersion in the Jordan River is to Christians. Swimming here cleanse sins and can cure skin diseases. Though seeing these significant sites was highly meaningful toward my greater Indian experiences, the real draw that brought us to Pushkar was for a desert camel safari! If you’re ever in the area and seeking an adventure, I highly recommend getting in touch with the folks at Pushkar Desert Safari. We made our safari trip in December, which is very much in the off-season. My travel companion and I were the only customers this weekend, so we got to have a special experience. We met our guides near the Brahma temple and were taken by motorcycle (yikes!) to where the camels were waiting for us. We loaded up and started through the town. We stopped at the Moon Lake and went down to the waterfront where we had Brahmin priests bless us for our journey. The sun was setting as we ventured away from Pushkar, and we had the most breathtaking desert landscapes changing colors with ever blink right in front of us. We even saw a Gazelle in the wild! I tried to take a lot of pictures of this, but very few of the photos came out thanks to the low light and the bumpy camel ride. It took us about two hours to reach our destination. Our camping spot was just a patch of sand with tent made of tarps. Inside the tent were two raised platforms we turned into beds with the pads that had been on top of the camel, acting as our saddle. The treatment we received at the camp was epic. We huddled around a fire; it was very cold, and the guides (7 of them!) prepared dinner. This food was easily the best thing I ate anywhere in India in my entire life. After dinner, we went right to sleep, and it is probably the hardest I have ever slept. I was exhausted. The desert air was so pure, but has it’s own smell which was new to me. It was a great atmosphere for rest. I woke at morning’s first light, and the guides already had ginger tea hot and ready. We had a quick breakfast and then started to head back to Pushkar. My camel, Romeo, behaved pretty well the day before but on the way back to Pushkar we had a hard time controlling him. Apparently there were several turns we could have made (but didn’t) which would have taken him to his girlfriend. He was not happy about not getting to see her. Camels are much taller than horses, and I was pretty scared of getting thrown off. My guide was confident that we wouldn’t get bucked, but I am still impressed that we didn’t! In the end, we prevailed over Romeo and got safely back to Pushkar. Once back in Pushkar, we had to move quickly to make our bus back to Jaipur. Our bus departed from Ajmer and to get back there we had to haggle with a driver pretty hard. He only agreed to take us after we decided to walk away, which is a great negotiating tactic. The guy chased us down and decided to drive us to Ajmer on a back road that seemed very much in the wrong direction and Google Maps seemed to confirm that we were just being taken out into the desert. This was a pretty scary moment trying to figure out if we were being kidnapped, but in the end, the road we were on took us exactly where we were trying to go and the driver was a pleasure to ride with. But you never know… All in all, this trip was one for the ages and I encourage you to visit Rajasthan when you have the chance! Questions? Additions?

    "title": "Why Travel While Young?",
    "body": "2016/02/21 - The greatest advantage I have had in life is that when I was young, I had many adults whom I respected tell me to, “do it while you’re young. ” Of course, “it” could mean anything: take a risk, start a business, save for retirement, but for me, it meant travel. One day after years of hearing their advice, I started listening and I’ve been on a grand adventure ever since.  This poses the question: Why Travel While Young? Why Travel? This is Why. : People say carpe diem like as if you don’t know what the future holds. Though you can’t know if this is your last day in good health or not, for many people, life can be somehow predictable. I’ve made this infographic to represent an average American’s life who sticks to the traditional routine of education, career, family and retirement. The dark blue represents things in our life which make travel more difficult. The yellow represents time of greater flexibility.  Let me break this down. Education: The first 18 years of our lives are spent getting educated. Unless you have a family that travels, chances are that you won’t have a lot of opportunities to go out and see much of the world. Even then, you won’t have much autonomy in making travel choices. The big exception to this is to become a youth exchange student. I am a supporter of the Rotary Youth Exchange Program, which I participated in at age 17 for a year in Germany.  (leave me a comment below if you would like me to connect you with your local Rotary Club for more information) Related Post: The Secret To All My Success The gaps between high school and college, and between college and starting your career, are excellent times to travel. Those are the two points in your life when you are truly free to choose for yourself. You may feel the pressure to hurry to college, or hurry to work, but the fact of the matter is that those things will always be there for you. If you want to hold off a week / month / year to gain some experience seeing the world, you will be that much more well prepared for those next-steps and seen as a much more attractive candidate by the gatekeepers of your future. Of course, you can also study abroad for part or all of college or graduate school. There are many programs that will fund your way to study around the world. When looking into these, you will read a lot of prestigious language which might discourage you from applying, but I assure you that they need you to apply as much as you want them to say yes!

Increasingly, recent graduates are discovering the importance of gaining a myriad of diverse experience. There is a big world out there and a lot to learn about it. As your first few jobs come and go, consider planning some travel in-between, or making one of these jobs at an international location. You may also be interested in participating with a professional fellowship program abroad. Related Post: Negotiating Travel At Your Job Your career may very well let you to travel and work abroad, but these jobs are rare. When traveling for work, you will have to travel at someone else’s discretion. Still, some of my best travel experiences have been on behalf of my employer. Look for careers that involve travel and find an employer which is flexible in working with you to pad business travel with some personal experiences as well. Family: The joys of starting and having a family is the pinnacle of achievement for many. However, that little bundle of joy does not travel easily or cheaply. The more mouths you have to feed and fly, the more difficult it is to afford travel. Plus, you aren’t likely to couch surf with a baby in tow. Once a child comes around, your next 18 years will be spent getting them ready to launch into the world on their own grand adventures. Consider for a moment that traveling before you start a family is one of the best ways to become a more well-rounded person, and an even better parent. The experiences you will gain from learning about a different way of doing things and different cultures (even in your own country) are the type of valuable life lessons you can give to your child and give them that much more of an advantage in their own life.

However, you can not know what life will throw at you along the way and retirement travel is simply a pipe dream for many.

    "title": "Tips For Negotiating Travel At Your Job",
    "body": "2016/01/30 - For many, the dream job often comes with at least a little bit of travel. Truth is, traveling for work is not a vacation. When someone else is floating the bill and watching the bottom line, they tend to care a lot more for the ROI than they do for your experience. That said, a lot of companies are glad to make you a happy employee if you take the initiative of negotiating travel by putting together a plan which demonstrates the benefits to all concerned. Top Tips For Negotiating Travel: I can tell a lot of stories on this topic, but here are the two greatest keys to negotiating a great travel policy with your employer:    Ask Early - If you don’t ask, they probably won’t offer. Ask early so that expectations can be set in advance of travel and accommodation being confirmed. Once the money is spent, you’re probably locked-in.     Demonstrate the Numbers - Create a spreadsheet to show the costs of travel strictly for work vs. the cost of granting you a few extra days. This can include a ticket with a third leg or a delayed return date. If the flight price doesn’t change and you are going to cover your own lodging costs for the additional dates, many employers will go along with your proposed plan.  Here are a few brief stories of how I have negotiated some awesome travel policies. Need advice? Have tips to add? Please leave a comment below and share your story with me at @judsonlmoore! Holiday Swap: Once upon a time, I worked for a company with a paid holiday policy which included Christmas, or any other substitute day (in the event you don’t celebrate Christmas). This was the written rule and since I had no family in the area and no plans to travel at that time, I requested to work that day so that I could have an additional paid holiday a few weeks later when I was going on a ski trip with friends. I sat in the office alone for half the day before the boss called and invited me to his place for festivities. I still got my extra paid day off and a great meal to boot! The takeaway here is to be creative. Know the rules of your current policy and if you can find a loophole, take advantage of it! Paid Time Off (PTO) Bonus: I worked abroad for a few months on behalf of my employer during the holiday season. I worked on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years, so before coming home in January, I set the expectation that I was going to make up those dates by first taking a vacation before returning to home base. I also leveraged the ‘hardship’ of being away from friends and family to gain a few extra paid days off. In the end, I vacationed in Europe for over two weeks and it only cost me three PTO days in return! I also found a flight home which allowed me that two-week layover in Europe at the same price as a direct flight home, so I got all of my airfare covered by the company too. This was an amazing experience, but one which required me to do all of the homework and demonstrate that I would come home a happy employee without costing the company any extra money. Unpaid Leave: From time to time, you might have reason to take off on an adventure or opportunity which can’t be tied to work and which is for a longer duration than your paid time off. For this, many companies do have an unpaid leave policy. Even though my employer had a written unpaid leave policy, I was super nervous the first time I asked to use it. Will they think I am quitting? Will they replace me while I am gone? What if they say no to my request? People take unpaid leave for a wide variety of reasons and if you have such a policy at your company, get to know who else has used it and ask them about the experience. I found colleagues who went on unpaid leave to write a book, tour Europe, and hike the Appalachian Trail. One great benefit of unpaid leave is that though you may not be getting paid your salary, you will probably maintain your other benefits such as health insurance. Reallocating Expenses: Here is the scenario: You are traveling for work for a few weeks. You are staying in a hotel for $140 per night and you have a per diem of $40 per day. You cost your company $180 each day while you are traveling on their behalf. Your work week is Monday - Friday, weekends are free to do as you wish. Now imagine this, if you check out of your hotel on Friday morning before going to the office and check back in on Monday afternoon after returning home from this office, this means you have $580 at your disposal to negotiate some fun weekend travel at your employer’s expense. I was in India for 6-months with a similar scenario as this. Every weekend I checked out of my hotel and went off to discover a different part of India. It was incredible. I almost never spent the full $580 on a weekend trip, even with flights, because I would stay at less expensive (but still very nice) hotels, or even go with a travel buddy who I split the costs with. I saw over a dozen epic destinations around India at no cost to me. While I was at it, I even saved my employer money. This was a perfect win-win scenario for everyone involved! Points: Be sure to register for all the reward points programs for your flights and hotels. This is essentially free perks for you, but they will pass you by if you’re not registered. Also, try to get your employer to put you on flights and in hotels that are part of the same rewards group (Star Alliance and SPG, for example). Expenses really add up when traveling. Consider getting a charge card which earns extra points on travel expenses and which have no foreign transaction fees. American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire Preferred are my favorite, but there are tons of options out there. For a very in-depth look at rewards programs, check out The Points Guy.

    "title": "The Secret To All My Success",
    "body": "2016/01/30 - Throughout my life I’ve been asked many times about my success. “How do you get to travel so much?” “How are you able to convince others to pay for your travel?” “How are you so lucky?” How. . How. . How. The answer to all of this is exceedingly simple. I did not grow up in a wealthy family. I did not have extraordinary circumstances. It was also most certainly not just luck. The secret to my success is that I showed up. But showing up can be trickier than it sounds. Let me tell you the story of when I first started showing up. Showing Up: My First Time: So what is the big deal about showing up? We all do it every day when we go to school, or attend afternoon practice, and finally when we return home. This might not sound like a special tactic to success, but I assure you that it is. My story began when I was 16 years old. I was attending a summer camp which had various community and business leaders come speak to us about leadership. One of these speakers was a representative of the Rotary International Youth Exchange Program. She told us about the program and how Rotary has a global network of community leaders eager to engage the next generation. She told us that Rotary provides for an early foundation of cross-cultural understanding through an exchange program which they fully fund. Rotary also makes all of the arrangements for schooling, living with a local family and participating in community events. The representative told us about living in Italy, Brazil, New Zealand and the Philippines, and that this only scratched the surface of the opportunity being presented in front of us. And here is the moment that changed my life forever… Upon the conclusion of the presentation, the speaker invited any interested student to come speak with her in private for more information. I thought to myself, ‘that is a line I MUST get in!’ But when the session ended, the other 50 students rushed outside for the water balloon toss and I was the only person who expressed interest. The result: one year later I embarked on a 12-month program to Germany! And this happened to me, instead of one of those other students, because I showed up when no one else did. When To Show Up: There are strategies for choosing when to show up. After all, time and energy are finite so you do need to be at least a bit choosy about where to focus your efforts. However, the best advice I can give is said very nicely by the old cliché, “the only way to guarantee failure, is to never try at all. ” That is to say, you should always try to the extent of your greatest ability. You and your own self-doubt are your own worst enemy. It’s human nature, so don’t feel too bad about that. In fact, I encourage you to embrace the fact that all people have doubts and all people hesitate to go for what they most want. This truth is why showing up matters so much, since most people never do show up. If you are the one in the room with the hand raised, or you are the one who has submitted an application, you are now among the elite few who have shown up, and this puts you at serious risk of getting exactly what it is you want. When opportunity comes knocking or someone invites you to learn more about an opportunity, I challenge you to approach your response with this quote in mind:  Every Day. Every Time. Without Fail. No Exceptions - Paul Cummings, CEO of Woople What are some examples of times you have shown up? What are your struggles? What are your successes?

    "title": "20 Essential Travel Apps from My Life on the Road",
    "body": "2016/01/30 - With tens of millions of apps out there in the world, it is hard to see the forest through the trees. Travels Apps are only a fraction of all apps, but still one of the largest categories of apps which you will find. I am either currently traveling, or thinking about traveling, literally all the time. Whether sitting on a plane, trying to cross a city or laying in bed at night dreaming of my next trip, these are the travel apps that I rely on the most.   Please also share your favorite travel apps in the comments below, or let me know what they are directly at @judsonlmoore! My Top Travel Apps: Google Maps: There are many maps apps out there, but none have the global reach or data of Google. Google Maps is more than just maps. It’s also full of business reviews, photos, tips, open hours and other useful information. Even the traffic data in Google Apps is a mashup of Google Maps and Waze users.  With the recent addition of offline maps, Google Maps is now my go-to maps app when traveling. Get it Now: iOS | Android Moovel: The savvy traveler knows that the best option is to have many options. But that can get complicated. Moovel takes the guesswork out of choosing the best way to get from Point A to Point B by aggregating data from a wide variety of transportation solutions. You will quickly be able to select from ride sharing, bike sharing, public transit and other methods to get you swiftly and cheaply to your destination. Get it Now: iOS | Android Check out my post about living in America without a car. Car2Go: Now operating in 30+ markets in the USA, Canada and Europe, Car2Go is an affordable car rental solution for A to B transportation. By downloading the app, you can see where a car is located near you. When you get to the car, use the app to unlock it and then drive to your destination. Park in any legal parking spot and walk away. You get charged for the time you use and that’s it. All the cars are Smart Cars, but don’t discount their small size; I’ve fit a 6’ bookshelf and 3 kegs of beer in one of these cars!Get it Now: iOS | Android ZipCar: For A to A (roundtrip) transportation needs, ZipCar is the way to go. They offer a wider variety of vehicles than any of their competitors for hourly and day rates. With cars in every major North American city and growing rapidly in Europe, this service is easy to find at a location near you. Get it Now: iOS | Android Couch Surfing: I travel to connect with people and cultures. Couch Surfing is not only the best way to gain a local perspective, but it also connects its users with free accommodation! The Couch Surfing community is more than just a place to sleep, it is also events to attend, new friends to bond with and a great way to build a global network. Get it Now: iOS | Android AirBNB: When in need of more than a couch, I turn to AirBNB. It’s cheaper and more flexible than hotels, and typically the accommodations are just as good or better than my choice hoteliers. I’ve also had amazing host experiences with property owners providing a compassionate touch in helping me get through a tough time and trying to figure out how to navigate their town. Get it Now: iOS | Android Trivago: When I need a hotel, I let Trivago do all of the heavy lifting. Trivago is the largest and fastest growing hotel search engine in the world and they make it effortless to find the perfect accommodation at the very best price. I really like that they connect the customer directly with the hotel rather than facilitating the purchase themselves, which is a huge benefit for locally owned hotels. Get it Now: iOS | Android Skyscanner: Skyscanner has proven to me time and time again to be the very best way to identify the best deals on flights, and with the greatest diversity of airlines. I love the feature which allows for leaving a destination open-ended so that you can just find the cheapest destinations around the world. Though many apps have the ability to set price alerts, I have had the best experience with the Skyscanner notifications. Get it Now: iOS | Android LoungeBuddy: If you’re a frequent traveler, premium credit card holder, or have a very long layover scheduled, you need LoungeBuddy. This app tells you the location and entry requirements for every lounge in every airport in the world. If you don’t have free access with status, you can purchase discounted one-time access to many lounges around the world, which is great if you have a long layover. The benefits of lounges are great, often including showers, free food and drink, comfortable seating, quiet space, internet and a general sense of serenity while on the go. Get it Now: iOS | Android GateGuru: Airports are typically pretty bad at providing signage to amenities within terminals. GateGuru is your global terminal map to help you find coffee, restaurants, terminal spas or whatever else you may need as you await your connection. Get it Now: iOS | Android Meetup: If you’re interested in meeting new people who have similar interests as you, meetup. com is full of fun activities. Ranging from volunteerism to coding to knitting, there are meetups for people of all ages and interests. The great thing about meetup. com is that you don’t require an invitation to participate, just find an event, RSVP and go have a great time!Get it Now: iOS | Android Rotary Club Locator: If you’re a member of Rotary International, or interested in visiting a local Rotary Club on your travels, this app will give you the time, location and contact information for any club in the world. Get it Now: iOS | Android Poncho Weather: I’ve recently ditched my long-standing beloved weather app in favor of Poncho. Poncho’s hilarious graphics, accurate weather and built-in alarm clock make it a versatile and smile-inducing way to start your day!Get it Now: iOS | not yet on Android :( Splitwise: Friend’s shouldn’t let friends borrow money, until now! With Splitwise, keeping track of who has paid for what and who owes who what is super easy. Invite your friends to a group (ie: trip, for example) and then as one person pays for a group taxi, covers dinner or gets the next round, Splitwise will keep track of the the numbers and tell you the most efficient way for everyone to get settled up. This is a must-have app for group travelers and roommates!Get it Now: iOS | Android Pocket: Pocket is a read-later app with a boost. The feature-rich free version syncs up between your mobile and desktop devices so that you always have access to the reading you want to save for later. I use this in concert with wikitravel. org to create my own travel guides before trips. Its been a lifesaver many times!Get it Now: iOS | Android Duolingo: If you’re headed to a destination where you need to brush up your language skills, Duolingo is the fastest and most enjoyable app for picking up some new vocabulary. It’s a social app, so you can compete with friends as you earn points while you advance your skills. Get it Now: iOS | Android Google Translate: For all those words and phrases you didn’t get to on Duolingo, let the Google Translate app do the rest. The pronunciation guide and flashcard generator also go a long way in saving key phrases to use later. Pro tip: turn your phone sideways and watch the screen change into flashcards!Get it Now: iOS | Android Find My Friends: Share your location with friends and family back home so that they can follow your adventure! This is also very useful in the event you misplace your phone or if you find yourself in trouble. This is a native app on iOS devices, but I found a great Android alternative as well, linked below. Get it Now: iOS | Android TunnelBear: VPN services allow you to watch your favorite shows on outlets like Hulu and Netflix when you’re traveling beyond their broadcast region. I prefer TunnelBear because of its simple and slick interface, plus those bears are super cute!Get it Now: iOS | Android Shazam: I love music! When I travel, I am always looking to connect with other cultures and people through music. Music is a core pillar of cultural expression and when I come home, I want to bring that with me. Shazam ensures that when I hear something new that I really like, I can capture that sound and find out what the song is and get more tracks by the same artist. Get it Now: iOS | Android MakeMyTrip: When traveling in India, this is the must-have app. All trains, the best flights and many hotels are exclusively booked on MakeMyTrip. Get it Now: iOS | Android GPSmyCity: This app is a tour guide in your pocket. With hundreds of cities around the world in its library, you will always be able to learn the historical context of the places you visit.

    "title": "Living Without A Car in America",
    "body": "2016/01/30 - After living abroad for a few years, I found myself coming home to America for a new job. I was headed to Texas, home of big trucks and vast expanses between places. I thought to myself that the first order of business would be to purchase a new vehicle, seeing as how I didn’t own one at the time. On arrival, the guy who hired me offered me a challenge: try living without a car for 30 days; if you hate it, buy a vehicle. I took his challenge and am happy to report that three years later, I am still blissfully living without a car! Living Without A Car: The Setup: I am not one to back down from a good challenge, so I accepted. It is now three years later, and I am still car-free! How? There are two critical factors to successfully living without a car:  Proximity - The places you need to get to on a regular basis should be near each other. Living not too far away from your work will be the major factor for most to consider.  Alternative Options - Living in a community with transportation alternatives will make or break your ability to live without a car. Proximity: I work downtown, so I live near downtown; 4. 1 miles to be exact. In my community, this is far enough away for the cost of living to be reasonable, but close enough to where I am in the core service area for many alternative transportation services. It’s also a leisurely bike ride or walk if the weather is nice. Further Reading: Top 10 American Cities for Living Without A Car Living in proximity to downtown is more expensive than living in the further-out suburbs, but my net savings are huge. When I had a vehicle, I was spending about $1000 a month on the car note, insurance, gas, parking and maintenance. Now, I rarely spend more than $150 in a month for transportation. My rent might be up $200-300, but at the end of the month, I am coming out way ahead. I am also saving a lot of time and headache  by not driving in terrible traffic. Alternative Options: I might not have a car, but I do have a very wide menu of transportation options at my disposal. Here is what I use on a day to day basis:  Public Transit Car2Go ZipCar Uber Lyft B-Cycle My own bike My own two feetWith all of these options, choosing the best method for right now is sometimes a burden. To help me figure it out, I turn to the Google Maps App (iOS / Android) and Ridescout App (iOS / Android). Go give those a look and let me know what you think about them by leaving a comment below. Public Transit: Living in a community with reliable and widespread public transit is awesome. In my community, I have a very good experience with the transit system. When I moved to town, I purposefully looked for housing that was on the same bus line as my office. Now I can go door to door in about 22 minutes on the bus. Car Sharing: Car Sharing services are sweeping the nation. If you live in a community with Car2Go or ZipCar, go get a membership, right now. Both services only charge for the time you use the vehicles (no reoccurring monthly costs). Car2Go is for one-way travel, while ZipCar is for roundtrip travel. Though it’s a bit more expensive, I find that Uber and Lyft are both very reasonable methods for hitching a ride across town when time is of the essence or when the weather is bad. Bike Sharing: If the weather is nice and you’re feeling like some exercise, check out your local bike sharing program! B-Cycle and Motivate are the two largest bike share programs in the States. To find a bike sharing program near you, click on your state on the map below (this will take you to another site). via Bikemunk Exercise: Of course you can also walk to where you are going if you have the time. I find that I walk the 4-miles home in about an hour. This is my favorite hour of the day because I get to listen to a podcast, call my parents, or just enjoy the fresh air and lack of emails. You can also invest in your own bike and use that to get where you are going much more quickly than your feet can take you.

    "title": "A Nomad's Philosophy to Relationships",
    "body": "2016/01/30 - For many years, I have had a philosophy regarding the quality of relationships. I have shared it with many people along my journey but I have never written about it. Recent events in my life make this philosophy seem increasingly relevant and so I would like to go ahead and share this with the world. First, I will note that when I use the term “relationship” I am not narrowing the focus to romantic relationships. This philosophy may be applied to friendships, business relationships, and romantic relationships.  A creative mind can also see that this applies in it’s extreme form of the relationship between you and someone you have never even had contact with (like a celebrity or politician). The philosophy is very simple. It states that the quality of all relationships, regardless of their nature, is fundamentally determined by two factors: shared experience and communication. If you communicate with someone with which you have had no previous shared experience, isn’t it quite difficult to relate? Alternatively, you may have many shared experiences with a person, but if you have never met to talk with them, then this is also a poor relationship. Long distance relationships are difficult to maintain. Why? I theorize that it is because even though you may communicate with other people on a very regular basis, that eventually genuine interest will be lost because you are having no shared new experiences with each other. Person A can tell Person B everything about their day. Person B can be genuinely interested in Person A and in the events being described, but after enough time passes this relationship is nothing more than Person A talking about Person A and Person B talking about Person B. On the other side, Person A and Person B can have lots of shared experiences: work together, attend class together live in the same neighborhood and enjoy the same foods and nightlife, but if they have never met each other to talk about their shared experiences, then their relationship is also a poor one. I do believe that the most common exception to this theory is seen during honeymoon periods when people always seem exotic, fresh and new. But that honeymoon period does come to an end eventually. Love and a long history of being in a high-quality relationship with another person can also deter the negative results of having too few shared experience or too little communication for a short time. The best way to keep any relationship healthy over the long haul is by continuous shared experience and maintaining good communication. Do you have examples of this being true or not true? Agree or disagree? Please write a comment below or message me at @judsonlmoore with your thoughts. "

    "title": "8 Things to Tell Your Family Before You Travel",
    "body": "2016/01/25 - All travel has a lot of moving parts (pun intended). For you, the traveler, you have thought a lot about where you are going, what you will be doing and when you will be doing it. You’ve no doubt committed a lot of time and thought into the decisions around your travel and you understand the rationale which informed these decisions. However, for every detail you’ve decided, there are likely to be a number of questions which others might ask. This begs the question, “what should you tell others before you travel?”  The most inquisitive and interested folks in all things regarding your whereabouts is likely to be your family. So, how do you keep your family informed without making them overly concerned for you and without driving yourself crazy in the process? Below are my principals, but I would love to read your comments with words of wisdom or stories of the experiences you’ve learned from. You can also message me directly at @judsonlmoore. 1.  Your Schedule: Once you know where you are going and when you will be there, you should share that information with your family as early before you travel as possible. I also advocate for sharing international travel information with the US State Department (or your own foreign ministry) so that they can send you travel alerts and more easily assist you in the event of a crisis. 2.  Tracking Your Progress: Maybe you’re going to post on Facebook or Twitter every day, or maybe not, depending on internet access and your desire to disconnect. Letting your family know how they can follow your adventure will help them feel more connected to your experience and also make your travel stories come alive when you return home and share.  You should also consider location tracking apps like the Find My Friends App (iOS and Android) so that your family can see at a click of a button where you are. This is also fantastic data to have shared in the event of an emergency. The bottom line is this: before you travel, set the expectations others should have about when they will hear from you next. 3.  Travel Companions: Traveling with someone? It’s your family’s job to be concerned for you, so relax their worries by letting them know who you will be with. Traveling solo? Then let them know that you understand how to stay safe and that you have researched the places where you are headed well before your travel. 4.  Health Update: Good health is easy to take for granted. To stay healthy, keep your immunizations up to date and check the CDC website for any health related considerations you need to prepare for before you travel. It’s also good to save a list of JCI Accredited Hospitals in the places where you will be visiting. If you take prescription medications, carry copies of the prescription in case you need to get a refill while away from your doctor. At the end of all that preparation, let your family know that you’re all up to date and share backup documentation with them in case you need it later. 5.  Backup Documents: Before you travel, it is always good to entrust someone with copies of your medical records, passport, birth certificate and anything else which you may need to replace your passport or to give to medical professionals if you are unable to do so yourself. My mother has a friend who accidentally put her passport and visa through the laundry the day before she was to cross a border and fly home. Her parents had to fax information to the US embassy overnight so she could get home. It happens to the best of us, so do your part to be prepared before you travel. 6.  In Case of Emergency: Travel comes at a risk, but then again so does crossing the street to get coffee. Emergencies can happen at any time and for any number of uncontrollable reasons. The only thing you can truly control is your level or preparedness.  If you have any sort of detailed emergency response plan (like I had in the Peace Corps), then make sure your family has access to all of that information before you travel. 7.  Don’t Worry: Travel is like a roller coaster in that though it may come with its ups and downs, millions of people travel every day and never experience any type of problem or emergency.  By taking the steps I’ve listed in this article and by affirming to your family that every thing will be fine before you travel, you will go a long way in getting them (and you) to live stress-free while you are out on your grand adventure! 8.  I Love You: Always tell your family that you love them. It can never be said enough and it is always the best last words that your family can hear from you, until they hear from you again! **And now I would love to hear from you! **Please comment below with your experience communicating with your family about travel. What concerns did they have? What made them excited? How did you handle telling them your plans? I am excited to engage with you on this topic! You can also message me at @judsonlmoore. "

The purpose of this article is to provide some high-tech resume tips which can be applied to any resume. However, you can gain access to my awesome high-tech resume template along with lots of useful notes when you subscribe to my email list. So go do that now. It’s ok.

For the purposes of this article, you will want to set your resume document share settings to “anyone with the link…can view. ”  Embed Links: Wherever possible, make your text link out to a reference. This is easily done by highlighting the text which you want to convert into a link, and then pressing the command+k keys. A small dialogue box will pop up and you can type or paste a URL into that. Click “apply” and the text is now a clickable link! Here are some things to consider linking:  Employer websites Email addresses of references Certificates Published workBe sure to style your links in an attractive way. I prefer to style my links to blend in with the rest of the text so that the document is attractive when printed, even though it means you can’t visually see the links, it makes for a nice subtle detail recruiters notice when they float their cursor over the document. You should also utilize a URL shortening service, such as bit. ly or goo. gl so that you can track how often and when each link gets clicked. This data can be super useful to you during your job pursuits. Make It Easy To Send Email: This is a little bit of a web developer’s trick, but it’s easy to do and I think it shows you to be innovative.  Here is the link that I have on my resume for my contact email.  mailto:getintouch@judsonlmoore. com?subject=I%20Read%20Your%20Resume!&amp;body=Hey%20Judson!%20I%20was%20reading%20your%20resume%20and%20wanted%20to%20get%20in%20touch…    mailto:getintouch@judsonlmoore. com this is the link base, which signifies the link should send an email to an email address.     ?subject= this extension to the link base allows you to customize your own subject line for the draft email which will be composed by clicking the link.

You can use these extensions:  https://docs. google. com/document/d/1AtH76fNIOcY7qPpdwEZK9Cv8fu4axDvZGHIymPJUSJw/export?format=pdf    export?format=pdf     export?format=doc     export?format=txt        Try it out now! Download my resume!

    "body": "2015/11/30 - I’ve done a lot of sharing my experience in Kyrgyzstan and I often find myself repeating my travel advice for the country. Where to go? What to see? Who to meet? So I have decided to put together a sample itinerary. This is designed for someone who has limited time in the country, just 1-2 weeks.

    "body": "2015/11/23 - M. Shafik Gabr and his Foundation: M. Shafik Gabr is a prominent Egyptian businessman and philanthropist. He has established a foundation in Egypt and in the United States to perform good humanitarian works of various sorts. In 2013, he began a fellowship program which encourages East-West dialogue. Each year since, the fellowship has supported 20 young professionals to come together for a month of travel, dialogue, and stimulating meetings with top leaders in Egypt and the United States. I am a 2015 fellow. Here are the notes from the sessions we had. They are as comprehensive as I was able to get them, but the deepest learnings came from simply listening and interacting. Join the dialogue by leaving a comment below. Learn more about the foundation and fellowship here. THE GABR FELLOWSHIP - Egypt PROGRAM: Friday, October 16 / Cairo: Guest Speaker: Mr. Rob Riemen, Founder, President &amp; CEO of the Nexus Institute Topic: Culture and Civilization: The Return of Political Extremism in the 21st Century Location: Ramses Hilton Hotel SATURDAY, October 17 / Cairo: Speaker: Mr. Karim Haggag, Deputy Director of Policy Planning at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Topic: Shifting Middle East Landscape Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    Arab Spring - a reaction to the cries for freedom away from authoritarianism. Driven by youth. Strive for democracy. Within 1 year, the paradigm shifted.     Muslim Winter - Authoritarianism reaction to Arab Spring to try and maintain tradition. This was a dismal display of power: Tunisia and Libya; failed to restructure.     Arab Spring / Uprisings - began to be regionalized … Syria, UAE, Lebanon, etc…     2005 - 2011 - Terrorism was not common in Middle East, but made a return in the form of ISIS     Options:          worse → much worse           recovery          There are shimmers of hope in the Middle East:          Egypt           a trend-setter in the Middle East           1st parliament, constitution… modern government           1st to pursue peace; signed Israeli peace treaty                Role of the USA              given all of the questions, turmoil and other factors in Egypt / Middle East, is the USA actually even relevant? What role should the USA play?                      Effective Counter-messaging does not come from government. It comes from other related players in the same sector as the source of the extremism. ie: non-radical Islamists fighting radical Islamists.                   Terrorist objectives have moved beyond bombs and 9/11 events. Now they want Statehood in the region and opportunity to be legitimate.     Muslim Brotherhood - oldest and most well-organized of the Islamist Movement leaders  Speaker: Adel El-Adawy: Topic: US - Egypt Think Thank: Egyptian Foreign Policy Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    The past 4 years have seen a lot of turnover and instability within high government roles     Egyptian Foreign Policy Circles          Regional Neighbors: Arab Circle           African Circle: re emerging now as an African leader           Mediterranean Circle: Italy, France, Spain are big players           International Circle: USA, UK, Russia, China          Major Issues          Israel / Palestine           Ethiopian Dam           Immigration (Mediterranean issue)           Climate change          Think tanks that Egyptian leaders listen to most are the official think tanks of government departments: not independent. Private think tanks are weak, under-resourced, and have little influence.     Mix of Military in Politics:          US / UK - clear division - however, the military does constantly advise politicians and lobbies for funding and authority           Egypt - blurred lines - during all of the political changes, the military was the only institution which remained stable enough to run the country while all the other areas fell apart. Because the military stepped in, Egypt has not fallen the way that Libya and Syria have.       Speaker: Mr. Hisham El Khazindar, Managing Director of Citadel Capital Topic: Egypt’s Economic Development: Moving Forward Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ Speaker: Dr. Mohamed Salmawy, President of Writers’ Union in Egypt Topic: Understanding Egypt’s Constitution Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    Egypt has always been a secular government. The people have always been very religious (invented 1st concept of religion) but never accepted a religious government     Public perception of Muslim Brotherhood is that because they had a religious base in ideology, the people supported them because they believed the Muslim Brotherhood would enforce social justice, fight corruption, and have high moral and ethical standards. Within just months of the election, they turned radical with their policies and claiming no decision from the president could be challenged. It also became clear that despite high education of Muslim Brotherhood, they had no idea about governing     Ousting of Morsi - Not a coup d’etat - this was a military action by request of the people to toss out the government, not a military decision to act on their own to take over the government and rule Egypt for themselves. Without this military action, Egypt would be in civil war.     Role of Youth - They are important and want change quickly. They drive a sentiment for action and because of social media and willingness to be vocal, they force accountability. They don’t unrealistically demand change tomorrow, but they do demand evidence of progress today.  Speaker: Mr. Paul-Gordon Chandler, Founder and President of Caravan Topic: Six Pillars Builds a Bridge: Creative Peace building between the Creeds of the Middle East and West Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    “If you have a monkey for a friend, you’ll never get your loincloth stuck in a tree. ”     6-Pillars of Islam (instead of the traditional 5)     Jihad - fighting an internal struggle. We should jihad a peace on Islam.     The sliver is so bright that we can’t see all we have in common on the dark side of the moon:      radical islam v islam      Watch the new Omar Sharif Video (ask the speaker what video this is)  Speaker: Ms. Lina Alorabi, Designer Topic: A Journey through Design in Egypt Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ  Traditional Ornate vs. Modern Minimalist furniture designSpeaker: Ambassador Mohamed Anis Salem, Head of Development Works Topic: Restarting the US-Egypt Relationship: a future-based approach Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    Alternate Futures          Status quo           Deterioration           Black Swan           ??           ??          Driving Component          National Interests           Military / Security Dimensions           Regional dynamics, wider alliances           Global changes           Focus on essentials          Convergence      Need to maintain Israel / EG peace   Speaker: Mr. Hussein Fahmy, Actor and Ambassador of Goodwill Topic: Bridge Building through Art Location: Ramses ARTOC HQ    Regional ambassador of Goodwill to the Special Olympics, Former president of the Cairo International Film Festival and leading movie star     “Never compromise your ethics”  SUNDAY, October 18 / Cairo: Visit to the Regional Center for Strategic Studies in Giza (including Lunch) Speaker: Mrs. Karen Aboul Kheir (Introduction about RCSS)  no notesSpeaker: Mr. Hossam Hassan (Egypt’s foreign relations)    Egypt is 90 M people     Coalition between Egypt and gulf Arab countries     Election monitoring issues. Understanding that elections here might not look orderly from American standards but they are greatly improved every time     During Mubarak period there were lots of talks about Egypt playing a lesser role in the Middle East. USA moved to weaken this relationship so as to increase instability and make it easier for USA to influence the region     Obama does not care so much about Egypt. Just not too concerned about the positions here     The current American election has totally new interests from the last time. The democratic debate last week didn’t talk anything about strategic relationships with the Middle East, but focused on Asia relationships.     Us congress …     Trying to make balance between Russia-US-Egyptian relationship     Egypt is Africa, but has not spent a lot of effort pursuing African relations. Trying to improve that now.     Egyptian public opinion of America is damaged by Egyptian media perception of American policy  Speaker: Mr. Aboul Fadl (Egypt’s parliamentary elections)    Parliamentary elections began abroad yesterday and today in Egypt     This is the very first multiparty election in Egypt. In the past it was always mono party     Based on three laws     1 -     1st round 14M registered voters     2nd round 28M registered voters     Parliamentary elections are usually about local issues where family politics play an important role, therefore, the tribal politics are very important     The church plays a big role because they can rally many Christian voters getting to the polls      how much participation to expect? Some say not more than 30% in the 1st round. But this will vary based on region, as much as 45%. In general election, could be as much as 85%.    Speaker: Mr. Mohamed Abass (US-Iran Agreement and its Repercussions)  no notesSpeaker: Mr. Ahmed Kamel (Egypt: The War Against Terrorism)    In the 70s terrorism was pursuing Shia law and only attacking government buildings and people. They pursued change in political atmosphere. Also attacked police.     Now it’s different because they attack random places to cause harm to just any person and to strike terror by people coming to know that any place could be a target     Also today the military is a target.     result of the war          Most of terror events take place in Cairo but with the least amount of casualties           Sinai alone represented 12% of terror deaths.           Terror spiked since 2012 constitutional referendum. Many more infrastructure attacks. 600 military and police casualties since then. Now Sinai has 40_% terror deaths          Egypt has massive boarders that are hard to control. But the military has become much better at guarding them and identifying breaches, especial tunnels. Over 200 tunnels have been destroyed in recent years  Speaker: Mr. Ali Bakr (The Muslim Brotherhood: A Historical Perspective)    Started as peace oriented political movement     Were able to create a belief that they are Islam and anyone against them are against Islam. Therefor many support them on for this purpose but the brotherhood abuses this blind following by supporting terror groups and giving them credibility. The very vast majority of people do support this but also don’t want to turn against the brotherhood because they believe that they are Islam     Eventually the military wing of the brotherhood grew too powerful to the point that they were ousted and became something else  Transportation to the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Mohandessin Speaker: Mr. Khaled Abdel Aziz, Minister of Youth and Sports Topic: Developing Young Egyptian Leaders Speaker: H. E. Mr. Amre Moussa, Former Secretary General of the Arab League and Chairman of the Constitutional Committee Topic: Egypt-US Bilateral Relations: Challenges and Opportunities The Arab Israeli Conflict (the Arab Peace Proposal) The Prolonged Occupation of Palestine The US-Iran agreement and the expected shift in the balance of power in the region The Syrian situation    Four Issues          Israeli / Palestine 1-state / 2-state solution           Sudan Dam           Writing the constitution           Why he left the Congress Party          “We need a new regional order”          With culture, regional security, laws and actionable plans           Optimistic about Egypt           Will be 120M people in Egypt very soon, all plans must factor in this scale (education, infrastructure, energy)           If the region is to be more stable, then it is necessary that all the factions in the region be part of the discussion          Iran Deal      It is good that we have made a deal and that it’s this deal. It must go forward. But, now that one nation has a nuclear deal in the area, other countries in the area must be given the same consideration. Military side should be prohibited, not the civil and energy side.       Israel / Palestine          There is a perception that Israel is getting _ because of everyone talking now about Syria. This is false.           Israelis ought to reconsider their regional policies, but they won’t; they only want to draw out endless talk with Palestine which will never end.           If 2-state solution can’t be worked out, fine, then make 1-state with rights for all.           Regardless, they must come to work together to live together.          Dam          Of course the other impacted countries have rights which need to be respected, but so does Egypt.           “It takes two to tango, and we can tango, if we have the right music. ”          Egypt is a country in distress… not yet out of the bottleneck=  Speaker: Eng. Mohamed Shamel Hamdy, Senior Vice President Operations &amp; Projects at Trident Petroleum Topic: The Secrets of Egypt’s Energy Map  no notesMONDAY, October 19 / Cairo: Meeting with Mrs. Lisa Anderson, President of the American University in Cairo Location: AUC New Campus    AUC founded in 1919. Original campus is now the Greek Campus.     3rd University in Egypt     New campus built in 2008     AUC is unique for their career services department. Not common in Egypt     Education of facts is no longer relevant, because all the facts of the world are in your pocket. What is critical is education which promotes critical thinking.     AUC is most expensive University in Egypt by a lot. However, the financial aid packages are very good  Meeting With Mr. Alaa Hashim, Chairman of Transcendium Limited Advisory For Independent Corporate Transformation, Advisor Location: AUC New Campus    Highlights of economics and development in Egypt     Very dynamic speaker, would be happy to be in contact with us in the future  Meetings with Mr. Hafez Al Mizari Location: AUC New Campus    3 Nationalized Newspapers ($3-8B USD in debt)     Since 1934 government owns all broadcast frequencies (every terrestrial medium)     1952 Military Revolution of Egypt     Germany was 1st to organize Arabic language outlets     QA          Controlled media? No. Not in USA (FOX) or in Egypt. Why? Because ….           No one “sitting in a dark room” directing media censorship, the media self-directs themselves to do as they believe they must. If they aren’t certain what to say, they just say nothing until the global news covers a topic, then the Egyptian media will slowly report information, cautious not to overstep, education is key, starts with ethics           Shorouk Newspaper is very harsh against government and they don’t have any problems. However, this may also be because their readership is small and it allows the government to point to them and say, “see? we don’t censor!”       Roundtable Discussion with: Dr. Ahmed Hassanien, Associate Dean for Undergraduate studies and Administration, and Dr. Ayman Ismail, Director of the AUC V-Lab Topic: Open Discussion  no notesMeeting with Dr. Ibrahim Awad, Director of the Center of Migration and Refugee Studies at AUC Topic: Open Discussion  no notesSpeaker: H. G. Bishop Moussa, Bishop of Youth Affairs Topic: Open Discussion Location: Cathedral in Abbaseya  Spoke a lot about the unity of Coptic Christians and Muslims in Egypt. That they have always had a good relationship and will continue to in the future. They work jointly on my community projects and have a high level of respect for eachother. TUESDAY, October 20 / Cairo: Speaker: Dr. Hala El Said, Dean of School of Economics and Political Science at Cairo University Topic: Overview on Political-Economic Landscape Location: Cairo University    Why so many military presidents? Because they are known to be the strongest leaders of the country and have the greatest discipline. They have the least corruption and do the most for the people. Because of this, civilians like the military leaders. Also, military is the most organized and the people see this and vote for it.     No k-12 education about what is a democracy. Only at university. K-12 only as national history education which includes information about the importance of the military.  Speaker: Mr. Abdel Ghaffar Shokr, Vice President at NCHR, with NCHR member: Mr. George Ishak, Mrs. Ragia Omran, Mrs. Neveen Mosaad, Mr, Kamal Abbas Topic: Open Discussion Location: National Center for Human Rights in Giza    National institution created by law, but independent of all other agencies. Oversees and studies all Human Rights issues in Egypt and advises policy on the topic. Monthly and annual reports of violations. 120 researchers on the council from all political, racial, religious, gender and other viewpoints.     UN HQ advises and assists     Secretary General of African Societies      tries to be bridget between Arab and African countries while maintaining EU-US-Asia-Russia-Egypt balance      (when I asked about citizen journalism, there was a lot of confusion. The answer revolved around social media but this is of course unmonitored. There was mention of a radio station, but no details. UNESCO has activities here, I should reach out to them. )     Google:          The Supreme Council for the Regulation of Media           The National Press Organization           The National Media Organization           “Different between citizen and community journalism”       Speaker: Amb. F. Awad, the Arab League Topic: The Effect of the Arab Spring on the ME Political Scene Location: The Arab League    1944 - established of the Arab League. Oldest multi-national league in the world, even before the League of Nations.     $65M budget only :(     Iran - Arab nations are not the only players     Arab League - Just helps the member states implement the decisions they make     Palestine / Israel          everyone is tired of talking about it, but it’s a shame we can overcome it.           politicians have to decide on this and they are too tired with a dead dialogue to get the voters to pressure American (for example) politicians           will take another 70 years - marketing efforts to middle america to count the Israeli lobby       Speaker: Honorable Mona Markram Ebeid, Former Parliamentarian and Speaker    Youth          Youth complain about the Government, but then they don’t vote because they see no benefit           “Thank goodness the Islamists also don’t vote”          Reasons for the Revolution          Police brutality           Rigging of the 2010 elections           Burning of the Two Saints Church in Alexandria, where 20 Christians were murdered                20 days and the revolution started by rally of youth in social media              Hopes for the future           Dignity is the issue. NOT democracy. The west forgets this. Egypt used to be #1 in Arab World with soft power: respect, allies, etc… but they lost that over the years           Jobs           Food                President Sisi’s popularity                      Mubarak’s overthrow after 1 year by 30M Egyptian citizens who asked the military for help                            Military agreed and gave a 1-week notice to Mubark to either call for elections or step down. When the clock expired and Mubarak had not complied, the Military moved in and took over with their own plan. The military stated the plan, followed the plan, held elections and the people were very thankful and voted the military leader into the presidency because they trusted only him.                             West was against this at first because Mubarak was the democratically elected president and the west wanted for the president to have his term and be removed democratically. Egypt doesn’t care about this, reminding that Hitler was also democratically elected.                                              Speaker: Dr. Mostafa El Fiky, Political Expert Topic: Egypt from Revolution to Reform    1952 - political revolutions had the rhetoric of “Best Egypt Ever” which is of course not true. Revolution comes as a result of the worst of times and only makes more divisions     Egypt is not the same as the Arab Gulf States on the Syrian issue          Different from Yemen           Disagreements with Saudi Arabia etal about what to do w/ Syrian President           Egypt not in a position because military is occupied in Sinai, Western border and anticipate Southern aggression          Egypt does not have diplomatic relations with Iran          To restore relations does not signify love for Iran, but is important to be speaking and building mutual understanding, in hopes of forming relations           Must disengage religion and politics. Sectarian state very important.           Muslim Brotherhood: 2 problems           1 - Shared state secrets with wider Muslim Brotherhood organization in other countries           2 - Blurred lines of state to Islamic World       Speaker: Mr. Ziad Aly, CEO and Founder of Alzwad for Economic Development Topic: Entrepreneurship for a New Egypt political changes in Egypt    70k followers on Twitter     Would take us on a cross-Egypt bike tour, seeing the real life of people.     Problems with you engagement post-Mubarak. They led revolt against him and then stopped participating     Website built by youth: yadaweya     Visit the Center for Independent Music in Zibaway (spelling?)     Zuma: vegan restauraunt (bring it to Austin!)     Madamasr (independent media)     Believes there is a huge opportunity to work with youth and the media  Speaker: Dr. Noah Bakr **get her deck** Political Science Professor at American University of Cairo (AUC)    Literacy rate is based on a 3rd grade level and above. This is a problem because the statistics show that there is high literacy in Egypt, but it’s at a very low standard with little critical thinking skills.     25 January Revolution wasn’t because of economy, it was because of the Egyptian identity being threatened by islamist extremists (Muslim Brotherhood)     1. 1:1 M/F Ratio     Population grew in 1981 - today from 44M - 90M. Wow! This is due to increasing unemployment so Egyptians had more free time to make families, returning to traditional values that larges families bring prosperity, but it hasn’t worked out that way (doesn’t work in modern economies)     Youth engagement is critical  Speaker: Dr. Tarek Ragheb, Founding Chair of the African Business Aviation Association    Egyptian-American. Served in USAF and was in high-ranks at CENTCOM.     Special Envoy to Uganda     “Arab Spring” is a term coined by the West. Doesn’t make sense!     Prefers dealing with republican insults than leftist over accommodation because political Islam is not the type of thing to become moderate by exposure to liberals     Political Islam is the single greatest threat to the West and the Modern World     Inclusion breeds moderation = True (for normal people) BUT with people whose supreme doctrine is a 1400 year old document, they will not compromise and you are wasting your time trying to negotiate with them or moderate them     “If you dialogue with and accommodate these people, they will exploit you until they are strong and then they WILL kill you. This is a fight for your survival. Understand that first. ”     “The Middle East doesn’t need democracy at this stage. They need governance to bring order. Democracy will come later. America took ~250 to get to today and for the first 200 years, African Americans and women couldn’t vote. Why does the Middle East have to evolve overnight? Give them 200 years too!

Mohamed Keshky, Assistant to the Minister of Defense and a Welcome Reception by Gen. Sedky Sobhy, Minister of Defense Topic: Egypt – US Military Cooperation Location: Ministry of Defense    Role of Egyptian Armed Forces in leading UN Peacekeeping Mission          Egypt in 1945 signed the UN charter (1 of 50)           1st UN Peacekeeping mission was in Egypt in 1949 for an Egypt / Israel mission           Egypt trains many of the African Union troops           Egypt is the largest troop force of UN peacekeepers           1st peace treaty in history was signed in Egypt (Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty, 1259BC)          Terrorism is not in all of Sinai, only three cities there     Q: Any efforts to reach out to USA voters about Egypt reality?          A: Not able to do. Only few in DC care about Egyptian politics. Experience shows that USA Media just looks to prove their own views and opinions.           Military plays 1% role in large construction projects, only to supervise, but not to manage or conduct the work. Keeps projects on schedule and prevents corruption          Egypt - US vs Egypt - Russia in Syrian policy          Egypt does not intervene in other nation’s affairs at this time because they are busy focusing on their own recovery for the last three years. However, if there is internal / civil Call to Action to go to Syria, then maybe they will. But all is complicated there and Egypt must focus on their own anti-terror initiatives           Lessons learned from Saddam Hussein means Egypt must reconsider what to do different in Syria.       Visit to Suez Canal: Meeting with Vice Admiral Mohab Mamish, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority Topic: The New Suez Canal: The Opportunities to revive Egypt Economy    Original open date in 1869 - 1M Egyptians built the canal, 100k died building it     $8. 92B USD provided by the citizens in 192 days via bonds to build the new canal     The canal is not just about the revenue. It is also for the future opportunities for redundancy, added industry, manufacturing and strategic viability of the whole region     Building the new Suez Canal was said to take 5-years by engineers’ assessment. The admiral overseeing the project was ambitious enough to say he could do it in one year. President Sisi came to the Admiral’s announcement event and told him in advance that he would be making a small request, but didn’t mention what it was. Then, when the admiral announced the 3-year project, President Sisi requested it be done in an impossible 1-year! But they succeeded in exactly 1 year and they are open for business!

Shafik Gabr Foundation for Social Development (Egypt)     Most important part of heritage preservation is people, not places, artifacts, monuments or architecture (as is often manifested in the work performed)     Selection Criteria          Originally was mandatory to have an even split between Islamic, Coptic and Pharaonic sites. This is more lax now, but it’s important to try to maintain this           Socioeconomic value, historic value and archaeological significance. . as well as future economic value.

E. Amb. Hamdi Sanad Loza, Deputy Foreign Minister for African Affairs Location: Ministry of Foreign Affairs    Q: Efforts of the Ministry’s press office to work with the foreign media?          A: Perception internally is that Egypt Government spends too much time speaking with each other and not enough time speaking with the rest of the world. They do work with the foreign media, but especially in USA it seems too impossible to impact the American Media’s views.           Welcome to discuss suggestions for improved EG-US Media relations          ISIS Situation      Arab world skeptical about USA in Syria because USA has promised to invade Iraq and make it a model of freedom and democracy in the region. USA failed and is making dismal efforts, so the USA’s credibility is very low. The region doesn’t want USA involved in-part because the USA breaks promises, fails goals, and creates situations which breed terrorism.       Counter Messaging Activities          ISIS’s message is very attractive to youth with troubled backgrounds who prefer to see a man with a gun, 2-3 women and speaking of fighting for a new caliphate. Especially youth already in trouble. These youth are not scholars and don’t have the advantage of better options in life, so ISIS becomes a great chance for them. The fight to counter this will be long and hard.           Q: If the MFA could assign one task to the Gabr Fellows to improve Egypt-West relations, what would it be?           A: Find and create professional means by which to share the realities of Egypt in the West. How to grow this and how to scale it.           *I suggested media relations organization with Government advisement. He suggested that Government should not be too close to any such efforts so as to avoid suspicion and lack of credibility.       Meeting with Ambassador R.

Speaker: Mr. Ahmed El Alfi, Founder &amp; Chairman of Sawari Ventures Topic: Transforming the Startup Ecosystem in Egypt Location: Greek Campus    Mr. Alfi lived a few years in Austin     Similar to Capital Factory / We Work, but doesn’t offer VC or mentorship. They are strictly a facility which builds culture and encourages collaboration and relationships to develop.     VC firms also have offices here, but the Greek Campus, as an organization, does not get involved in that because they find it would be a conflict of interest for them.     800 employees here     “Therapy for entrepreneurs”     Tech Wadi - event between Cairo and Silicon Valley, sponsored by Google.

FRIDAY, October 23 / Cairo: Tour at Giza Pyramids and Sphinx Walking Tour at El Moez Street and Khan el Khalili SATURDAY, October 24 /Cairo - Alexandria: Visit to the Roman Amphitheatre Meeting with Mr. Hany el Missery, Governor of Alexandria Location: Alexandria Governorate    Appointed in February 2015     Egyptian - American. Grew up in Alexandria. Degree from UCLA. Spent most of his life in USA and Switzerland. Was CEO of a major petroleum company. Was asked by Egyptian government to serve and agreed but only if it was in Alexandria.     Governors in Egypt are not elected, but are appointed by the Prime Minister     Alexandria has 30% cotton industry and 40% petrol industry in all of Egypt     5M residence + 3M seasonal workers in summer. 33km of shoreline     Goals: Health and Education. Everything else is extra     Proposal to build a series of 3km x 1km islands, each dedicated to different sectors (education island, medical island, etc. . ) Similar to the UAE.     Need to create tourism operations reality that the best tourist sites are elsewhere in Egypt. Alexandria has only 1-2 sites, so starting to work to attract expats in other ways (like conferences) but this means building hotels and other infrastructure.     Women - 1st deputy governor and district director ever in Egypt to be women are now here by this governor’s appointment     Alexandria really doesn’t view people by gender, faith or race. They are Alexandrians and very proud of their diversity and of this identity being maintained at all costs.     Converted trams into cafes and now they earn 10k LE / day instead of the 3k LE / day they were receiving a year ago. Tons of other innovations in public facilities, services, authorizations / startups (Microsoft), etc. .     Youth          Facebook: Live Alexandria           WhatsApp Groups           Youth Parliament - youth aren’t being constructive. They just want. They have this forum, but they just come with problems and not suggesting solutions, but the governor is trying to engage them.          Infrastructure          Sewage: City is growing too fast and sewage is overflowing. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) model is the way to address this. Not common in Egypt, but it’s a proven model in the rest of the world and should be used here.           Buildings: taking down buildings in violation of codes. “sweet grandmother problem”           Trash: 100k of 15M / month is being paid by government to the trans contractor. Big deficit problem.          lol: he fired a district head via WhatsApp     Has 13k employees but has only meet 12 of them because the governor’s office was burned down and everyone is scattered. He only needs 10 people to get the job done.  SUNDAY, October 25 / Alexandria: Speaker: Dr. Ismail Serageldin, Director of Bibliotheca Alexandrina Topic: Egypt: 2011 To Date Showcasing the work of Bibliotheca Alexandrina Revolutionary thinking about the future of libraries generally and the BA specifically Speaker: Ms. Al Zahraa Adel, Egyptologist Topic: Alexandria: a Cosmopolitan City MONDAY, October 26 / Luxor: Speaker: Dr. Ahmed El Tayeb, Grand Sheikh / Grand Imam of Al Azhar Topic: Open Discussion Location: Al Azhar    The institute reaches          2M k-12 students           10k university students           ~50 institutes in Africa and Asia           ~80 University faculty           40k foreign students          Education is totally free (tuition, fees, room / board, books, etc. . )     “There is only 1 Islam. Is teaches love, acceptance of others, accepting and co-existing with other, no matter who you are. ”     “To see violence and harm caused by others in the name of “Islam” is confusing and outrageous.     132 countries represented in these schools. Scholarships available for all students     Funded by the endowment, Egypt government, private donors and several other nations, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE     The Grand Imam is the top scholar at the Al-Azhar     Believes it is programs like the Gabr Fellowship which creates the dialogue necessary to lead to better East-West understanding and cooperation and bringing down the walls that are dividing us.     There is no room in Islam for struggle or the imposition on to others for how they should be     The Grand Imam is from the west bank of Luxor     Q: some Imams say things on Friday prayers which incite violence and fear. What is Al-Azham doing about this?      A: Of 90k mosques in Egypt, maybe 10 speak radical things. This is a low statistic but it does cause a problem. Every 6-months, Christian priests and Imams come together to discuss this and then take a stance on the streets together to discuss with the public what has been discussed      Q: Does the Grand Imam represent Sunni or Shia Islam?      A: There is only 1 Islam. The sects of Islam still have the same 1 god and believe the same things, just express it in a different way      Christians are members of one church and this builds community and understanding. In Islam, a mosque is a mosque, but also you can just pray where you are, which means that this strong sense of community Christians have, doesn’t exist in Islam. Probably this is the cause of some perception problems.     Judgement Day’s role in Radicalization: &gt;1% believe in this ideology but this is what fuels radicalism’ (kill infidels and get 21 virgins, etc. . ) It’s ridiculous.

The program is broken down into two parts: the first part will be a six week period of travel throughout Egypt and the United States with a group of twenty young professionals; the second part is a six month window in which to complete a development project in Egypt. The participants come from a wide variety of professional sectors and are all emerging leaders in their field. There are ten fellows from Egypt, nine from America and one from England. While traveling, we will meet daily with economic, political, civic and arts leaders in order to gain a better understanding of Egyptian and American cultures. In Egypt, we will visit Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor. In the United States, we will visit New York, Washington DC and Atlanta. As the fellows get to know one another, we will begin to form small groups and author action plans for development projects that can be implemented in Egypt. As part of the application process, each of us has already written an action plan. You can read my action plan here, as an example of the type of work we will conduct. It is a great honor to be selected as a Gabr Fellow and I will keep my blog and Twitter flowing with photos and updates. Subscribe to my newsletter for the most exciting updates.

    "title": "How Hurricane Katrina Changed My Life 10 Years Later",
    "body": "2015/08/29 - Photo Credit: From LSU: In The Eye of The Storm There are events in my life that I often reflect on for being the pivotal moments when the trajectory of my life changed. Great moments like my Rotary Youth Exchange year and not so great moments like appendicitis in Kyrgyzstan have led me to who I am today. I am glad for all of these things because the life I live now is truly a fortunate one and I wouldn’t change how I got here. Hurricane Katrina is one of these events, and now after a decade has passed since that destructive day, I reflect on how my life has been impacted. Hurricane Katrina: A Decade Later: On this 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, I take note that I rarely consider this event to be one which shaped the course of my life. I don’t know how I’ve missed it, I don’t know why I’ve been so consciously avoiding it, but that moment was for me, as for so many others, perhaps the single most important event of my life. Katrina led me to two years of employment with the Red Cross. Katrina taught me everything I know about emergency preparedness. Katrina taught me about how easy it is for disaster to strike close to home. Katrina taught me to be always generous when walking amongst the plight of others. Katrina is the reason why I chose to abandon my work responsibilities two years later during Hurricane Gustav and lend a hand once more to those in need in Louisiana. Katrina piled on a sense of responsibility in me when I joined the Peace Corps. Katrina gave me many of the tools I have today which makes me a strong candidate for the US Foreign Service. Katrina is always with me, reminding me to be a service-oriented Rotarian. Perhaps I’ve missed identifying this pivotal moment because I was too caught up in the moment, or maybe because I never wanted to view that disaster as something which molded me into a better person. Whatever it was, ten years later, I remember the experience and all of my loved ones who played inspiring roles in making that moment one which truly mattered. Though I can’t say this about the storm, I can say wholeheartedly that I am thankful to each and every one of you who were part of that trajectory change. Be well in the world wherever you are, and never forget. In memory. "

    "title": "I Have Joined The Rotary Club of Austin",
    "body": "2015/08/18 - I’ve hit a great milestone in my life today: I am a Rotarian! I’ve been part of the Rotary Family since I was in high school, and anyone who knows me, knows that this is a very significant moment for me. The club I joined is the Rotary Club of Austin in District 5870.  We meet Tuesdays for lunch at St. David’s Episcopal Church in downtown Austin. If  you are ever in the area, come join us! Here are some photos of the pin ceremony, followed by a letter I wrote to the folks that got me started down this path 16 years ago. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3662,3663,3664,3666”] An Open Letter To The Rotary Club of Alexandria: Tuesday August 18, 2015 16 years ago, this club sponsored Judson Moore to participate in Camp RYLA. Literally half a lifetime later, he is at this moment being introduced to the Rotary Club of Austin Texas as their newest member. Judson asked that I take a moment to recount his journey over these last 16 years as a testament to that investment we made in him, and to encourage us to continue making similar investments in CENLA youth. Here is what Judson writes to our club today: Dear Rotary Club of Downtown Alexandria, Today is a day that I’ve been looking forward to for half my life. The journey I’ve been on since we first met has been amazing and I do try at every opportunity to make you proud. Please allow me a moment to share with you where your impact has led me. After Camp RYLA, I went on to serve as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student for one year in Oldenburg Germany. Before starting college, I spent six months backpacking Brazil, alone, where I volunteered with local Rotary projects throughout the country. Back in the United States, I became active in Rotaract and went on to serve in leadership roles at the local, district and international levels, as well as being the Program Chair for the 2011 RI PreConvention in New Orleans. Through all of this, I have had a myriad of professional experiences striving to make the world a better place. I worked as the Emergency Response Planner for the American Red Cross in southern Louisiana during post-Hurricane Katrina, traveled the United States with the biggest names in music entertainment as a concert producer, and then decided to get back to my roots and dedicate myself to serving humanity in the United States Peace Corps. Now residing in Austin Texas, I contribute to the growth of the Austin business community as the co-founder of the Brazos Technology District and as part of the Operations Team at Mutual Mobile. Later this year, I will travel to Egypt as part of the Shafik Gabr Foundation Fellowship, which aims to encourage collaborative projects between Americans and Egyptians. In the coming year or two, I hope to begin a career with the United States State Department as an American Diplomat; I’ve already past their exams and received a Top Secret clearance, but the waiting list does take quite some time to get through. In these short 16 years, I feel like I have had lifetimes of experiences. I recognize and remember at every one of life’s intersections how I have moved down this road and it all started in 1999 when this club supported my candidacy to participate in Camp RYLA. I thank you for what you have done for me, what you have done for my generation, and for what I am certain you will continue to do for those whose journey is about to begin.

Tuesday August 18, 2015 16 years ago, the Rotary Club of Alexandria sponsored Judson Moore to participate in Camp RYLA. Literally half a lifetime later, he is at this moment being introduced to the Rotary Club of Austin Texas as their newest member. Judson asked that I take a moment to recount his journey over these last 16 years as a testament to that investment we made in him, and to encourage us to continue making similar investments in CENLA youth. Here is what Judson writes to our club today: Dear Rotary Club of Alexandria, Today is a day that I’ve been looking forward to for half my life. The journey I’ve been on since we first met has been amazing and I do try at every opportunity to make you proud. Please allow me a moment to share with you where your impact has led me. After Camp RYLA, I went on to serve as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student for one year in Oldenburg Germany. Before starting college, I spent six months backpacking Brazil, alone, where I volunteered with local Rotary projects throughout the country. Back in the United States, I became active in Rotaract and went on to serve in leadership roles at the local, district and international levels, as well as being the Program Chair for the 2011 RI PreConvention in New Orleans. Through all of this, I have had a myriad of professional experiences striving to make the world a better place. I worked as the Emergency Response Planner for the American Red Cross in southern Louisiana during post-Hurricane Katrina, traveled the United States with the biggest names in music entertainment as a concert producer, and then decided to get back to my roots and dedicate myself to serving humanity in the United States Peace Corps. Now residing in Austin Texas, I contribute to the growth of the Austin business community as the co-founder of the Brazos Technology District and as part of the Operations Team at Mutual Mobile. Later this year, I will travel to Egypt as part of the Shafik Gabr Foundation Fellowship, which aims to encourage collaborative projects between Americans and Egyptians. In the coming year or two, I hope to begin a career with the United States State Department as an American Diplomat; I’ve already past their exams and received a Top Secret clearance, but the waiting list does take quite some time to get through. In these short 16 years, I feel like I have had lifetimes of experiences. I recognize and remember at every one of life’s intersections how I have moved down this road and it all started in 1999 when this club supported my candidacy to participate in Camp RYLA. I thank you for what you have done for me, what you have done for my generation, and for what I am certain you will continue to do for those whose journey is about to begin. Your Fellow Rotarian,Judson Moore  Visit the website for the Rotary Club of Alexandria and join them for lunch any Tuesday! "

These guys came on to the pop culture radar by having the featured and impossible to play bonus song at the end of the Guitar Hero video game. They performed in Austin Texas at the outdoor stage of The Mohawk, which is one of my favorite venues and conveniently located just a few blocks away from my office. After work, some colleges and I walked down the hill to catch the show in the rain. It was an epic evening! DragonForce Performs Through The Fire and Flames!: This is THE song! Best known for being the closing credits song at the end of the original Guitar Hero game, Through The Fire and Flames has inspired a generation of gamers to click harder and faster than anything else in console history. DragonForce Dueling Guitar Solos!: What decent rock show doesn’t have a guitar battle? These guys are clearly having a great time! Despite messing with each other so much on stage, they do not miss a single one of the million notes they play. What great musicianship, and so nice to see people truly enjoying themselves!

It is best known for its main church, the Niederaltaich Abbey Church. The abbey is part of the Benedictine Order and was founded in the 8th century. I stopped by the abbey to see if I could get a tour and what came next exceeded any dreams. I met Father Stephan, one of the deacons of the brotherhood and he took me around parts of the Abbey that are rarely seen by anyone.  My friend Martin and I with Father Stephan Photos From Around the Abbey Church: Known for its frescos and Baroque design, the church is a treasure of Bavaria. The exterior architecture of the church is not as opulent as one might expect from a German church, but this modest exterior brilliantly contains wondrous treasures for the eye.

Mark and I worked together in Kyrgyzstan to develop skills of journalists and media professionals. His trainings are one of the reasons why KyrgyzMedia. com has become so sustainable over the years, so clearly I am very grateful for his skill and friendship! First Impressions of Brühl: Brühl is a small town in west Germany between Cologne and Bonn. The well-manicured paths through surrounding fields and nature make exploring the countryside estates and palaces a breeze. Germany is well known for ease of access and walkability, but Brühl stood out from the crowd in this regard. Though I was visiting in the dead of winter, the beauty of the region shone through clearly. Unlike most of west Germany, there are actually some fairly significant hills here which provide wide views of the surrounding region. Now that I am living in Düsseldorf, just 53km away, I plan to ride my bike down for a weekend and get some more photos from atop these hills. Stay tuned for that! Augustusburg Palace: The Augustusburg Palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, noteworthy for being one of the finest examples of Rococo interiors in the world. Because the palace was closed on the day I visited so I just got to explore the historic hunting grounds around the palace, but I will certainly return and get the full tour soon!

    "body": "2015/01/16 - After spending 5-months in India building out a new facility for Mutual Mobile, I get to take a few weeks of vacation! I am returning to Germany for the first time since my high school Rotary Youth Exchange year in Oldenburg and am very excited to reconnect with old friends. My fist stop on this journey is Köln, known in English-speaking circles as Cologne. After flying Hyderabad &gt; Abu Dhabi &gt; Frankfurt I got a first class ticket on the ICE 102 to Köln and began my relaxing 3-week tour of central Europe. Here is a preview of the beauty to come. First Impressions of Köln (and beer!): Upon arriving in Köln (Cologne), I met Bettina and Maxim, whom I know from my time in Kyrgyzstan. After a quick change of clothes and a smorgasbord of cheese and meat, it was time to get this 3-week pub crawl underway. Each region, city and sometimes even neighborhoods in Germany are distinguishable by the kind of beer available. Köln is home of Kölsch beer, a German lager, which is crisp and refreshing. Kölsch is served in small glasses so that you can drink it before the temperature has a chance to rise, and similarly to a Brazilian steakhouse, you will have more beer in front of you before you can put the empty glass on the table unless you indicate you are done drinking by putting a coaster on top of the glass. This beer is fun, even before the server dressed like Uncle Fester gives it to you. Bettina and I went to at least half a dozen breweries in search of the best Kölsch in Köln (say that 10 times fast!), of which Früh is the most famous and Peters Brauhaus had the best beer. We drank lots of beer and ate lots of wurst and schnitzel, but burned off the calories as we meandered up and down beautiful cobblestoned streets and in and out of churches and museums. The Architecture: The Kölner Dom (cathedral) is over 700 years old and was once the tallest building in the world. On the day we visited, the catacombs and the tower were both closed, so we just got to wander the main hall, which is certainly impressive enough. The sub-freezing overcast weather and lack of internal lighting made the space fairly dark, leaving a fair impression of what the cathedral would have been like hundreds of years ago. Adjacent to the Dom is the Romano-Germanic Museum. This archeological museum is home to many impressive facades, archways and sculptures dating from the time when Köln was ruled by the Holy Roman Empire. The museum is located here because during WWII, Nazi engineers who were digging to construct a bomb shelter unearthed evidence of a 3rd-century roman villa. Of what remains of the villa today, the most impressive thing is a large section of floor known as the Dionysus Mosaic. One of the adjacent mosaic floors is decorated in swastikas, which is pretty weird if you think about it, especially from the perspective of the guys digging who only expected to find dirt, and instead find the same symbol as was on their uniform. Köln is an amazingly beautiful city, even in the freezing cold. I look forward to returning soon when the weather is nicer! Have you been to Köln? Planning a trip to the region?

    "title": "India Travel Guide - What I Learned After 6 Months On The Road",
    "body": "2015/01/15 - I have seen so much of India at this point that I feel like I can give you some good advice and connect you with folks in each area of the country. In the event that you visit India, I think the below India travel guide will be very helpful. Please, add your comments below! How to get around India:       For regional travel, trains are a great way to get around.  The official online train ticket portal is here, but that site is difficult to work with, and you have to create an account before you can even see what the schedules are. The better way to book train tickets is with Cleartrip (iOS    Android) or with RailYatri (iOS   Android).   They typically don’t accept foreign debit / credit cards though, so it might get tricky. You can easily buy at the station, but you might want to get at least your first ticket booked before arriving in India if you’re getting on the train right away. Hotels and hostels are often helpful with booking train tickets, for a fee, of course. The train classes are very complicated and are a legacy of the caste system. You can learn all about the train classes here. I recommend traveling in 1AC (First Class Air Conditioning).    Carz On Rent is a very affordable service for hiring cars. You can easily book online with them. Rates are inclusive of the car, driver, fuel and a bunch of miles. Carz On Rent is great for hiring a car for a full day, or for a days-long road trip. Uber works in most cities and is crazy cheap and very reliable. I recommend that you get a local SIM card for your phone so that the drivers can contact you. I have learned that you often need to send the Uber drivers a text message with an exact description of where you are and that you are ready. Though the maps on the Uber app are fairly accurate, a lot of drivers won’t start coming your way until you call or text them with a specific location and say you are ready.  Having an Indian mobile number is the key to many things you might like to access in India. For example, free public wi-fi which often requires you to register an Indian mobile number in order to receive a serial number and pin code to login. If you want to book any bus, flights or hotels in India, then use the website or app for Make My Trip. Air India is the national carrier and has the worst service. IndiGo is the best and has the cleanest aircraft. Sleeping In India: The best hostels are Zostel. They cost a few dollars a night are all placed in prime locations and have very good conditions. There is a Zostel in most Rajasthan destinations and as of 2016 have expanded to15 locations across India! AirBNB is also reliable. (that AirBNB link will give you a $25 credit!) If you are looking for slightly more posh accommodations, then check out the Trident family of hotels. I lived at the Trident in Hyderabad for the duration of my stay and often stayed in their other properties when I was able. Related Post: The Trident Hotel and Poverty Where To Go In India: What India travel guide would be complete without the mentioning of some destinations? The most popular tourist route is the Golden Triangle: Delhi &gt; Agra &gt; Jaipur &gt; Delhi. A great travel plan would be to land in Delhi, see Delhi for 1-2 days, and then go by car to Agra. Agra only requires one day, but you should arrange your travel to see the Taj Mahal at sunrise. Don’t be late. Contact Sarfaraz on Whatsapp (+919412330010), he is an amazing guide. He is a university professor and is very knowledgeable about all things Agra. His rate for me was INR 950 for 4 (or maybe 6) hours. While in Agra, you must see the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort. I also highly recommend seeing the Taj Mahal from across the river; no one is over there, and you can get an awesome photo like this one: Jumping in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. From Agra, take an overnight train all the way to whatever your furthest away destination is if you’re thinking of returning at the end to Delhi. So that means take a train to Jodhpur, Udaipur or Jaisalmer; then work your way back toward Delhi for your return flight. Aside from that, I can give you specific advice from my experiences in Jaipur, Ajmer and Pushkar (links are to my other blog posts for those destinations).  Wiki Travel and Trip Advisor will be your friend throughout any travel. You should try to see Pushkar. It is the holiest site in Hinduism and is the location of Moon Lake which is believed to be the origin of the Earth. If you have time to do something other than the Golden Triangle, then you should go to Dharamshala, the home of the Dalai Lama. Check his schedule to see if he will be home while you are around. If so, he often gives teachings which open to the public, you just have to show up way early. Also, if you go there, I have a fantastic contact for buying the best jewels, rugs, carpets, Indian handicrafts and Tibetan paintings, and at fantastic prices.

    "title": "How Its Made - The Mutual Mobile Office in Hyderabad India",
    "body": "2015/01/09 - It’s no secret that I’ve spent some time in India, but I am frequently asked, “why were you there?” I know that I am better at documenting my weekends and time off, but I don’t just travel the world for fun, I do have a job to get done! It is now my great pleasure to unveil to you the new office of Mutual Mobile in Hyderabad, India! If you have ever built a space in another country, or were part of building this space, please tell me about it in the comments below, or message me directly at @judsonlmoore! Mutual Mobile Sends Me To India: In India, my job was to launch a new facility for Mutual Mobile in the city of Hyderabad.  This mission was an enormous challenge and a wonderful experience, but I didn’t have to go at it alone. We already had an office in Hyderabad with about 50 employees. Before I arrived, that team expended significant effort scouting a new location and negotiating a lease on the new space. I went to India once that space was selected and helped identify architects, designers and builders who would turn this concrete box into a cutting edge and inspiring place to work. I stayed in India and managed the project until the facility launched 5-months later. Before I went to Hyderabad, I established what my personal measure of failure would be. For me, failure would be indicated at any point where I had to make a decision. Of course, I am capable of making decisions, and I am not hesitant to share my opinions and insights. However, at the end of this project I will leave India, and it is the Indian team that will need to maintain their new facility and have a sense of ownership for it. Therefore, they need to own the decisions. Additionally, if at any point my and their opinions differ so drastically, and I feel so strongly about my view that I overrule them on a decision, then we have gotten to a very bad place. Therefore, if ever I make a decision on this project, I have truly failed. This Was A Collaborative Effort: I am very thankful to too many to count, but I can’t go any further without acknowledging Abin Chowdhury, who’s hip I was attached to for five months. I also relied heavily on leaders of the Mutual Mobile Culture Club and Design teams to generate ideas and design decisions for the space. The architects from Ajay Pershad’s firm, the engineers and builders with Space Matrix and the sales team with Haworth, were all closely held team members throughout the course of the project. I am very thankful for their guidance, and at times, patience, in seeing us through to a successful and on-time finish. The New Office: A Concrete Box: Upon seeing the new space for the first time, I knew I was up against a new kind of challenge. The sum of my construction experience comes from a tree house I built when I was 12 and sets that I’ve designed for community theater productions. This was neither of those things. Our to-be future home in India was a 10th floor unfinished space with rough floors and not a single piece of conduit or ductwork to get us started. We even had a private lake to wade through. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3442,3443,3444,3445,3446,3447,3448,3449”] Establishing The Vision: Starting from scratch was a great advantage for our design expressions. The only element that defined our design restrictions was the shape of the building. We went through many floor plan variations and even several different architects before we found what we were looking for. Indian business culture is very hierarchical, and typical office layouts reflect that. Early iterations of the floor plan featured manager offices and conference rooms along the windows while putting workstations toward the interior, away from natural light. The space is L-shaped with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows along the entire outer perimeter. The views from our 10th floor windows are awesome. The nearest buildings are far enough away to prevent claustrophobia from setting in and most of them are nice designs. Many buildings in our immediate line of sight are not very tall, and so we look right over and past them. There is a nice park and Greek amphitheater out one corner, and the other end of the office has spectacular views of the sunset behind a lake. Setting Priorities For The Space: Since this access to natural light and great views is the best asset of the space, we wanted a floor plan that would give as many people as possible access to these elements. Therefore, we moved all of the conference rooms to the center and built only one office in the corner, albeit with a great private view. After locking in the floor plan, our next order of business was material and color selection. We selected Haworth as our primary furnishings vendor. Haworth provided all of our chairs, desks, tables and modular cabinets. The design team liked the new carpet we had in our headquarters office, so we stuck with the same carpet from Shaw, even though it had to be shipped all the way from the USA. I found a great Indian designer for our sofas and huddle furniture, Urban Ladder. The rest of the materials (paint, glass, laminate, vitrified tile, hard flooring, raised server flooring, lighting and countertop material) all came from vendors through Space Matrix. Here is a quick look at the final materials and colors that we chose for each element of the office. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3450,3451,3452,3453,3454,3455,3456,3457,3473,3458,3459,3460,3461,3467,3462,3463,3464,3465,3466,3470,3471,3468,3469”] The Foundations Get Set: While we were busy working on the color and material choices, construction was underway. The first tasks to complete was the laying of floor electrical conduit and then pouring the screed to give us a smooth, level floor. As with most projects, the vast majority of the time was spent laying foundation work, which as time progressed, made us more and more nervous that we weren’t moving quickly enough to meet our deadline. Here are some photos in chronological order from the first day through the third month of construction. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3477,3478,3479,3480,3481,3482,3483,3484,3485,3486,3487,3488,3489,3490,3491,3492,3493,3494,3495,3496,3497,3498,3499,3500,3501,3502,3503,3504”] And Then Came The Floods: With just a few weeks until the grand opening, disaster struck! The floor above ours was also under construction, and the water from the screed was seeping through the concrete slab and dripping down into our nearly finished space. We had to replace sheetrock in the ceilings and some walls. Luckily, we caught the problem quickly, and the building management assisted us in a solution and in paying for damages. The disaster turned out to be a minor setback, but the timing was less than ideal. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3505,3506,3507,3508,3509,3510”] In the last two weeks, the finishing touches came together almost overnight, transforming the construction zone into a believable office; all it needed was furniture. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3511,3512,3513,3514,3515,3516,3517,3518,3519,3522,3523,3520,3521,3524,3525,3526,3527”] The Greatest Challenge: When people ask me what my greatest challenge in India was, I tell them, without hesitation, that it was the procurement of anything. Buying things in India is incredibly difficult. Firstly, locating the item you need proves to be such a task that unless you have a true need for it, you are likely to give up looking before you ever find it. Once found, all prices must be haggled through several rounds until you feel that you are on the upside of a win-lose situation. When the deal is finalized, issuing payment becomes a nightmare, especially in business. The P. O. system of invoices and crosschecks, last minute renegotiations and the issuance of paper checks, to then learn that the government just changed the tax rate, or the item which was available a week ago is no longer in-stock, or the vendor changes their mind about selling you the item at all, makes the process too cumbersome to bear. I once waited 5 weeks for some HDMI cables to be delivered, despite the vendor telling us on the first day that they were available and could be delivered the next day. On top of this, you can’t really just walk into a store and buy something, and online shopping rarely produced the selection we sought.  It’s a nightmare. The most difficult and project-threatening of these procurements was for our internet service. We had signed a contract with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) months before, and when the fated day of installation came, they had forgotten all about us. On top of that, the building was not honoring to provide the ISP with a proper hosting room in the building where their equipment could be stored before sending fiber cable up to our server room. Many dozens of emails, heated phone calls, meetings and legal interventions finally resulted in our getting internet just days before the grand opening. I had the honor of sending the first Tweet through our active internet line at 10pm on New Years Eve. Celebrations ensued like it was 2015!

It will be very exciting to see what products will come out of this space! I’ve done more than enough writing up until now. So I will let the photos tell this part of the tale.

Our Co-CEOs came for the occasion and led the ribbon cutting honors. We had cake and ate it too (with our hands) and hired a live band followed by super fun karaoke. Oh, did I mention we have a helipad? We did a company-wide sunset champagne toast on top of the building. It was awesome!

What was most impressive, is that when I offered up an opinion or suggestion, he spoke up and shot me down if he felt that it would take us off-message. Rarely (if ever) in India did I come across someone who had the backbone to say “no” when it needed to be said. And for that, I would work with Ankit again in a heartbeat. Conclusion: This whole project was a deeply impactful time in my life. The people I got to know, the country I got to experience and the skills I developed will all be with me for a lifetime. Thank you to all that made it fruitful and to Mutual Mobile for seeing it fit to send me to India in the first place. I am also happy to report that in the duration of this project, I never made a decision. Success accomplished! So what do you think about the space and the process?

This ashram is home to a large Satsang temple. Satsang is an Indian philosophy, which teaches a process of spiritual meditation, which encourages people to listen to, talk about, and assimilate the truth. This typically involves listening to or reading scriptures, reflecting on, discussing and assimilating their meaning, meditating on the source of these words, and bringing their meaning into one’s daily life. The ashram is a beautiful building of white marble surrounded by massive boulders, forest, and a compound of living quarters and facilities that accommodate Satsang pilgrims who travel here for periods of spiritual reflection. The Satsang Festival: On this day, there was a festival for the Satsang Sri Sri Dada 4th Anniversary Celebration. The festival had a wonderful performance of traditional Indian song and dance performed by the famous Sonali Fine Arts Institute. I was honored with being sat at the center of the front row and was even asked to come on to the stage to help pass out awards to some students. I was also given a nice framed memento of the ashram. After the performances, we had a tasty dinner and then waited for sunset to observe the daily evening prayer. Throughout the day, I was humbled by the overwhelming hospitality and eagerness of everyone who wanted to know me. The prayers, the dances, the music and the food were all equally fantastic. I greatly appreciate Abin, his wife Antara and daughter Abheepsa for including me in this festive day!

    "title": "Pushkar - A Camel Safari In The Heart of Rajasthan India",
    "body": "2014/12/15 - The Town of Pushkar: In the heart of Rajasthan is a small town called Pushkar. To get to Pushkar, we took a train from Jaipur to Ajmer, then walked two miles to a taxi stand where we hired a car to take us the rest of the way, about a 30 minute drive. Pushkar is one of the most significant pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, created Pushkar. Despite the significance of Lord Brahma, there are very few temples in the world are dedicated to him, thanks to the Curse of Savitri. The Pushkar temple is, however, the most significant of the Brahma temples and viewed by many as the only legitimate temple. Pushkar is widely considered to be one of the most religious places in the world. Where Hinduism and The Universe Began: As legend has it, Lord Brahma killed the demon Vajranabha while it was attempting to murder his children. Lord Brahma’s weapon is the lotus flower. Upon striking the demon Vajranabha, three petals of the lotus flower fell to the Earth and created three lakes, including the lake at the center of Pushkar, which would later be visited by Lord Brahma himself. During his visit, he married a consort who was not his wife, Savatri. When Savatri learned of this marriage, she cursed Lord Brahma such that he would never be worshiped except for in Pushkar. It is because of this act that the Pushkar temple is considered to be the only temple that can be or should be dedicated to Lord Brahma. The lake which Lord Brahma’s lotus flower petals formed in Pushkar is the other majorly significant site to see in Pushkar. I was told that the name of the lake is “Moon Lake,” but I’ve not been able to find any reference to that name online; most places just call it the “Pushkar Lake. ” A dip in this lake is to Hindus of similar significance what a submersion in the Jordan River is to Christians. Swimming here cleanse sins and can cure skin diseases. Though seeing these significant sites was highly meaningful toward my greater Indian experiences, the real draw that brought us to Pushkar was for a desert camel safari! If you’re ever in the area and seeking an adventure, I highly recommend getting in touch with the folks at Pushkar Desert Safari. A Night With a Camel Named Romeo: We made our safari trip in December, which is very much in the off-season. Tobi and I were the only customers this weekend, so we got to have a special experience. We met our guides near the Brahma temple and were taken by motorcycle (yikes!) to where the camels were waiting for us. We loaded up and started through the town. We stopped at the Moon Lake and went down to the waterfront where we had Brahmin priests bless us for our journey. The sun was setting as we ventured away from Pushkar, and we had the most breathtaking desert landscapes changing colors with ever blink right in front of us. We even saw a Gazelle in the wild! I tried to take a lot of pictures of this, but very few of the photos came out thanks to the low light and the bumpy camel ride. It took us about two hours to reach our destination. Our camping spot was just a patch of sand with tent made of tarps. Inside the tent were two raised platforms we turned into beds with the pads that had been on top of the camel, acting as our saddle. The treatment we received at the camp was epic. Tobi and I huddled around a fire; it was very cold, and the guides (7 of them!) prepared dinner. This food was easily the best thing I ate anywhere in India. After dinner, we went right to sleep, and it is probably the hardest I have ever slept. I was exhausted. The desert air was so pure, but has it’s own smell which was new to me. It was a great atmosphere for rest. The Desert Sunrise and a Camel’s Love Life: I woke at morning’s first light, and the guides already had ginger tea hot and ready. We had a quick breakfast and then started to head back to Pushkar. My camel, Romeo, behaved pretty well the day before but on the way back to Pushkar we had a hard time controlling him. Apparently there were several turns we could have made (but didn’t) which would have taken him to his girlfriend. He was not happy about not getting to see her. Camels are much taller than horses, and I was pretty scared of getting thrown off. My guide was confident that we wouldn’t get bucked, but I am still impressed that we didn’t! In the end, we prevailed over Romeo and got safely back to Pushkar. Things Almost Went Sideways…: Once back in Pushkar, we had to move quickly to make our bus back to Jaipur. Our bus departed from Ajmer and to get back there we had to haggle with a driver pretty hard. He only agreed to take us after we decided to walk away, which is a great negotiating tactic, but he decided to drive us to Ajmer on a back road that seemed very much in the wrong direction and Google Maps seemed to confirm that we were just being taken out into the desert. This was a pretty scary moment trying to figure out if we were being kidnapped, but in the end, the road we were on took us exactly where we were trying to go and the driver was a pleasure to ride with. But you never know… All in all, this trip was one for the ages. Here are a few photos.

    "body": "2014/12/13 - Arriving to Ajmer: My first train ride in India led me to Ajmer, a small town in the heart of Rajasthan. A German friend of mine, Tobi, who is also staying at my hotel in Hyderabad, joined on this weekend adventure which also covered Jaipur and Pushkar. Ajmer is a small town of only 500,000 people (which is a small town in these parts). The town was easily walkable, which is what we opted to do for the mile journey to Daulat Bagh, a park on Ana Sagar Lake. In the park, we came across an interesting temple to Lord Shiva. I would later learn that king cobra snakes are present in all of Lord Shiva’s temples, but in Rajasthan they seem to be much more prominent. Despite this, I only came across one real king cobra snake on my journey and I was more afraid of its charmer than I was the snake its self. More on that in my post about Jaipur. Lake Ana Sagar: After the temple, we continued on to Lake Ana Sagar, a 900-year old manmade lake. The prominent feature about this lake is a 5-pavilion marble structure known as Baradari. I am not sure what the significance of this site is, but it’s expanse of white marble overlooking the lake is beautiful; no wonder the tourists flourish to this site. The weather was perfect and the fresh air coming off the lake was a welcome reprise from the dry air of the desert. We only had a few hours to spend in Ajmer, so after finding a quick coffee we hailed a cab and moved on to the nearby town of Pushkar where we embarked on an overnight camel safari!

    "title": "Jaipur - Home of Royalty, Castles and the Kama Sutra",
    "body": "2014/12/13 - The Pink City: The Pink City is called as such because all the buildings here are painted a reddish pinkish color to imitate the red sandstone architecture of Mughal cities, from which Jaipur is fashioned. Jaipur is the largest city in Rajasthan, and it is the place that I had intended to be my first destination to travel to in India. Because of the abundance of amazing invitations I received from friends and colleagues to tour other destinations, it’s taken me three months to actually get here. The famous Golden Triangle of India is the route that connects Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, so that should tell you something about how important of a place this is. The Amber Fort: Many of India’s most infamous landmarks reside in Jaipur. The most glorious of these is the Amber Fort. To enter the fort, one must ride an elephant up the mountainside at a price steeper than the mountain its self, but it is well worth the 10-minute experience. While ascending to the fort, I dropped my sunglass case on the road far below me, but not to worry, the next elephant picked it up and handed it to me! After a short Purell bath, the case was as good as new. Once inside the Amber Fort, we were overwhelmed by the architecture and detail work. Between the geometric gardens, facades with incredibly preserved details and surviving paintings of the Kama Sutra, the space was a lot to take in. All of that was small potatoes compared to the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace). The Mirror Palace is a space within the Amber Fort, which is covered in tiny convex-shaped mirrors. The light reflecting off of all the surfaces shifts as you walk through the space and the feeling is very dazzling. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3335,3334,3333,3332,3329,3330,3331,3327,3326,3325,3324,3214,3117,3112,3110” orderby=”rand”] The Jal Mahal: We spent a few hours at the fort and then moved along to explore the rest of Jaipur. Directly across from our hotel is Jal Mahal (Water Palace). This palace is a manmade island and structure for which the original purpose wasn’t explained to me, but which is now closed to the public and slated for renovation as a fine dining establishment. This 5-story structure of Rajput and Mughal styles will be a grand place to dine, but the high level of pollution in the lake will make it challenging to maintain an appetite; the foam and water’s edge was literally seafoam green. Since we couldn’t go out to the Jal Mahal, we just took a few photos and then went into the heart of Jaipur’s old town. The second most architecturally impressive structure in Jaipur is called Hawa Mahal (Wind Palace). Aside from the stunning wedding-cake layered details of the building, it is special because of the abundance of windows, many of them only the size of a head. These windows were viewing portals for the royal family to look out on the city and people as they would gather around the front of the City Palace. With the windows open, the whole building is filled with a breeze that makes the desert’s summer temperatures more suitable for royalty. The City Palace: The Last Active Residence: Behind the Hawa Mahal stands City Palace, the old capital of the Rajasthan State and seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. Much of the palace is open to the public but it is still an active royal residence, so the residential chambers are off-limits. However, you can buy a $100 ticket that will allow you to walk through the living quarters of the current Maharaja. Imagine paying $100 to walk through the Queen’s apartment at Buckingham Palace! The City Palace is home to some pretty interesting architecture, paintings, and artifacts, including the Ganges-water urns: the two largest sterling silver objects int he world. The purpose of these vessels was to carry water from the Ganges River from India to England for the 1901 coronation of King Edward VII so that the Maharaja of that time would not have to drink the English water. The vessels are 1. 6 meters (5. 2 ft) height and each have a capacity of 4000 liters. They weigh 340 kilograms (750 lb) and are made from 14,000 melted silver coins. One art piece that I thought was striking was a number of rifles and spears that were laid out in a large circle. The guns are pointing in toward the center while the spears are pointed out toward the edge. The guide said that it was to symbolize Indian strength and wealth, but I think it symbolizes the imperial occupation of Britain who had a superior military versus the Indians who had less advanced weaponry. There is a photo below, so you can make your own opinion about it. [gallery link=”none” type=”rectangular” ids=”3115,3119,3121,3123,3125,3127,3129,3131,3341,3342,3343,3344” orderby=”rand”] "

Thank you to my dear friend Laura and her family for hosting me while I was in Dubai. Laura and I worked together on my cornerstone project while in the Peace Corps. She was a key player at UNESCO, who funded the project, so, she is one of my favorite people on Earth. Laura drove all the way out to Abu Dhabi to pick me up after I did my sightseeing there. In Dubai, she spent a whole day making sure I got to make the best of my few hours. We went to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest man-made structure in the world, standing at 829. 8m (2,722 feet). The structure is super impressive and it’s front yard features a fountain with a dancing water show which just puts the Bellagio in Vegas to shame. Check out the 2015 NYE celebration at the Burj Khalifa. We also took a drive to the outer rim of the Palm Islands, which is home to the Atlantis Hotel. Near to there is the Burj Al Arab, the sail-shaped hotel on the beach. Finally, I got to ski in the desert at Ski Dubai! This day fulfilled many bucket-list items! I didn’t get so many photos, despite all the amazing structures. The sun seemed to always be in the wrong place so many of the photos were washed out. Also, everything in Dubai is about being the grandest, biggest, best thing ever, and every structure’s competition is the structure right next to it. The result is that being in Dubai is a bit overwhelming and you start to get a sense that what you see simply can not be captured on a camera. Therefor, I just enjoyed the moment and my time with Laura. Here are a few shots that came out though. [gallery link=”none” ids=”3085,3086,3087,3210,3211,3084,3083”] "

I’ve dreamed of visiting the United Arab Emirates for such a long time but even with all of my travel experience, this has always felt like a place too distant, too exotic and so far out of reach that I might not ever get here. However, thanks to a 36-hour layover in Abu Dhabi on my way back to India from Colombia, I got to experience a few of the key landmarks which I’ve always hoped to see. Uber is truly my favorite service in the world. I landed in Abu Dhabi, connected to free wifi while waiting in the customs line, requested an Uber, and when I walked out of the airport there was a beautiful new Lexus waiting for me. The Sights of Abu Dhabi: My first destination was the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, the largest mosque in the UAE. It’s architecture and materials are inspired by the Taj Mahal. It is an impressive compound and in many ways it is much more impressive than the Taj Mahal, but having now experienced both structures, I have my doubts that the Sheikh Zayed Mosque will still be standing in 350 years. Regardless, it’s a beautiful place; very photogenic! Next up: Heritage Village. This dusty spot is a reconstruction of what life was like in this part of the world before oil brought about a modern economy and all the luxuries that come with. There are lots of local handicrafts on sale here but what makes it really interesting is that you can visit with the artisans in their shops where they are making textiles, metalworks, wood and stone carvings, etc. . There is also a nice museum showing many artifacts from the old days. Near to the Heritage Village is a landmark simply known as the “flagpole,” which makes sense, because at 123m (403. 5 feet), it is among the world’s tallest flagpoles, and you won’t miss the massive UAE flag hanging off it. After this, it was time for me to head to the Marina Mall and find internet so that I could connect with my dear friend Laura who I would soon meet up with and drive to Dubai. More about Dubai and Laura in my next post. Please forgive my appearance in these photos; I’d been on a plane for over 24-hours and had no rest before going directly to see everything I could.

    "body": "2014/11/11 - A Reunion In Colombia: I recently made a 12-day trip to Colombia to reunite with a few friends from my year as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student in Germany. We visited several fantastic places around the country and had the best local insight available thanks to Alejandro Borda who organized our time in his country and made sure we were well-entertained. Bogotá: The Capital of Colombia: Our first days were spent in the capital city, Bogotá. On the first day we explored the Monastery, Cerro de Monserrate, which has breathtaking panoramic views of Bogotá. After some photo ops with local school children, we went down into the city center and spent several hours at The Gold Museum. This museum is the most extensive collection of gold artifacts in the world. Located in a region of town called La Candelaria (the old town), the museum is next to the national capital and some very interesting architecture. [gallery link=”none” ids=”2937,2938,2939,2940,2941,2942,2943,2944,2945,2946,2947”] Cartagena: Costal Paradise of Colombia: After having a chance to recover from jet lag, we headed to the coastal city of Cartagena. This is one of the most visited destinations in Colombia for the rich and the famous; we had just missed Prince Charles by a few days.  The Old City is where you want to spend all of your time in Cartagena. The beaches there are dirty so you will need to leave the city or go out to the islands to find the clear water (easily done by boat). There is an old fort in Cartagena, Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, which is totally worth checking out. Other than that, everything is either far away or just in the Old City. In the Old City, you will find amazing food. The ceviche here is incredible everywhere, but the best is at a small shack just outside the front doors of the airport (map). Come out from baggage claim, cross the street and take a right to the first intersection. Take a left. The shack will be 200’ on the left sidewalk. The best desserts on the planet are at Mila Pasteleria. Great coffee too. I also had amazing and very reasonably priced sushi at Teriyaky. La Cevicheria is the best seafood in town; I ate the Seafood Paella, but you can’t go wrong at all with their menu. The best coffee you will find anywhere in Colombia is at any of the Juan Valdez Coffee Shops, but be warned that they don’t necessarily open early or on schedule. I found that the souvenir shopping was pretty “meh. ” If you see one street vendor or one shop, then you’ve pretty much seen all of your local selection. You can shop till you drop at one of the many designer stores, but the prices in the Old City are greatly inflated from what you would find anywhere else. I didn’t see much value in that, but hey, you only live once, and if you see something you just have to have, go for it. I didn’t make any purchases here other than flip flops for the beach. [gallery link=”none” ids=”2948,2949,2950,2951,2952,2953,2954,2955”] Isla Palma: A Drug-Induced Island of Colombia: The destination that we considered to be, at least during the planning phase, the main event, was the 3-day all-inclusive visit to Isla Palma, an island resort which used to be the summer home of famed drug cartel boss, Pablo Escobar. The island is located a 3-hour bus ride south of Cartagena, followed by a 30-minute boat ride out into the Caribbean. The island is beautiful and has a great mixture of refined resort, island charm and overgrown development which makes for some great exploration. Though most people would go gaga over the beaches and crystal clear water, I care little for the white sands of the beach and am much more thrilled by the system of elevated trails we found in the jungle which made us feel like we had stumbled upon something long-forgotten. Between the jungle flora and fauna and the sense of adventure that this forgotten section of the island provided us, it was exploring back here that I most loved. [gallery link=”none” ids=”2959,2960,2964,2963,2961,2958,2957,2965,2956”] Villa de Leyva: Mountain Adventures: Our next destination is the preserved town of Villa de Leyva. Located a 4-hour drive north from Bogotá nestled in rolling hills and a landscape that was, to me, what I expected Colombia to look and feel like. The architecture is uniform: white stucco with red tile roofs. The streets are paved in stones, and I must admit, the ladies here wearing high heels are even braver and more graceful than the Kyrgyz women who wear heels in winter, which is really saying something! The first day was spent wandering the town’s historic streets and enjoying a sunset behind the mountains and dark rainclouds which only impacted us long enough to make us seek refuge in a Brazilian cafe; I was totally ok with that. The second day here was my favorite time of the whole trip. We rented 4-wheelers in the early morning and set out on a 30km ride through the jungle to see a group of seven waterfalls named “La Piriquera” 15 km away from the town. When we arrived at the waterfalls, we first had to zip-line down into the valley and then take a short hike to the main fall. Coming back up was a bit more challenging, ascending straight up the mountain only using a knotted rope to climb with. This day was full of adventure and beauty, all complete before lunch!

If you go to Colombia and don’t go here, you should truly feel like you’ve missed out on something grand. Dubbed, “a wonder of the world, the first wonder of Colombia,” photos can’t do this place justice. Just get there.

The most famous place to eat in all of Colombia is Andrés Carne de Res. There are 2 locations in Bogotá. One is in the city center (fashion district) and is new and corporate feeling. The original location is just outside of town. If you get a chance, go to the out-of-town location. It’s like Hard Rock Cafe, Cracker Barrel, Tex Mex, BBQ and a hoarder-artist estate sale had a freak baby who turned out to be a culinary prodigy. Andrés Carne de Res is the best place to eat, drink, and party on the weekends. Closes at 3am. Prepare for steep prices on the drinks, but it’s well worth it. The food is very reasonably priced and the best meat that I had in all of Colombia (which is REALLY saying something!) [gallery link=”none” ids=”2970,2969,2968,2972,2971”] A Surprising Place For The Best Breakfast: Crepes and Waffles is a chain that employees only women (well, a few men) who come from very bad domestic situations in rural areas and need an escape. The food is incredible, the prices low and the cause just. There is one in the Bogotá Airport, which I actually ate at on-arrival and for my last meal. No regrets there. A note about Lemonades: On every menu anywhere you will see a section for “Lemonades. ” This is not what we would think of Lemonade in the USA. It’s more like fresh-juices, blended with ice. They are incredible. Getting a Colombian SIM Card: A good thing to note if you are traveling to Colombia is that Uber works very well in Bogotá but nowhere else. That said, you should get a SIM card with data when you land at the airport. The service provider I had is called Movistar. It cost me ~$7 / week for 800 MB of data and was very reliable everywhere I went. Public WiFi isn’t really a thing, and most coffee shop WiFi will want you to authenticate using a pin code that they send to your cell by SMS. So you need the service. English isn’t common, so bring a pocket translator with you (or use the Google Translate app if you get that data SIM card) if you don’t have any Spanish skills. A Learned Best Practice: I have found that WikiTravel is the best website in the travel. I am a big fan of the app, Pocket. It is a read-later app which allows you to download websites and articles for later offline reading. I saved all the WikiTravel pages to Pocket for all the places I was planned to go, that way when I arrived I could always reference locations and history. There is a balance to maintain between being well-informed and ruining the surprise for yourself, but at least having access to some information is very helpful. I prefer WikiTravel to Wikipedia because it’s more topical facts like “see this; it is at this location” rather than the whole history of the place. It’s also better (to me) than Trip Advisor because there are no ads, and it downloads more easily. My Dirty Little Secret: I make some bold statements here about places being “the best available. ” How could I know this, I was just there for a short time! Well, the trip was organized by a friend of mine who is from Colombia (Bogotá) and who has travelled extensively throughout the country with his job (producing video and photo shoots for Colombia’s top models) and he knows the ins and outs of everything there. If you plan a trip to Colombia, you will be well-served to follow my footsteps! Have you been to Colombia or are you planning a trip there soon?

The architecture is uniform: white stucco with red tile roofs. The streets are paved in stones, and I must admit, the ladies here wearing high heels are even braver and graceful than the Kyrgyz women who wear heels in winter. The first day was spent wandering the town’s historic streets and enjoying a sunset behind the mountains and dark rainclouds which only impacted us long enough to make us seek refuge in a Brazilian cafe; I was totally ok with that. Day Two: Chasing Waterfalls: The second day here was my favorite time of the whole trip. We rented 4-wheelers in the early morning and set out on a 30km ride through the jungle to see a group of seven waterfalls named “La Piriquera” 15 km away from the town. When we arrived at the waterfalls, we first had to zip-line down into the valley and then take a short hike to the main fall. Coming back up was a bit more challenging, ascending straight up the mountain only using a knotted rope to climb with. This day was full of adventure and beauty, all complete before lunch!

The island is located a 3-hour bus ride south of Cartagena, followed by a 30-minute boat ride out into the Caribbean. The island is beautiful and has a great mixture of refined resort, island charm and overgrown development which makes for some great exploration. Though most people would go gaga over the beaches and crystal clear water, I care little for the white sands of the beach and am much more thrilled by the system of elevated trails we found in the jungle which made us feel like we had stumbled upon something long-forgotten. Between the jungle flora and fauna and the sense of adventure that this forgotten section of the island provided us, it was exploring back here that I most loved.

If you have some tips to add, please do so in the comments below or by messaging me directly at @judsonlmoore. Arriving to Cartagena: After having a chance to recover from jet lag, we headed to the coastal city of Cartagena. This is one of the most visited destinations in Colombia for the rich and the famous; we had just missed Prince Charles by a few days.  The Old City is where you want to spend all of your time in Cartagena. The beaches there are dirty so you will need to leave the city or go out to the islands to find the clear water (easily done by boat). There is an old fort in Cartagena, Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, which is totally worth checking out. Other than that, everything is either far away or just in the Old City. In the Old City, you will find amazing food. The ceviche here is incredible everywhere, but the best is at a small shack just outside the front doors of the airport (map). Come out from baggage claim, cross the street and take a right to the first intersection. Take a left. The shack will be 200’ on the left sidewalk. The best desserts on the planet are at Mila Pasteleria. Great coffee too. I also had amazing and very reasonably priced sushi at Teriyaky. La Cevicheria is the best seafood in town; I ate the Seafood Paella, but you can’t go wrong at all with their menu. The best coffee you will find anywhere in Colombia is at any of the Juan Valdez Coffee Shops, but be warned that they don’t necessarily open early or on schedule. I found that the souvenir shopping was pretty “meh. ” If you see one street vendor or one shop, then you’ve pretty much seen all of your local selection. You can shop till you drop at and of the many designer stores, but the prices in the Old City are greatly inflated from what you would find anywhere else. I didn’t see much value in that, but hey, you only live once, and if you see something you just have to have, go for it. I didn’t make any purchases here other than flip flops for the beach.

    "title": "Agra Is Home of The World's Oldest Fairy Tail Tragedy",
    "body": "2014/10/27 - An Epic Journey to Agra: Bucket list: check! After an 18-hour drive direct from visiting the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala, I’ve made it to Agra to see the Taj Mahal! There is a Trident Hotel here in Agra, and I was able to arrange a room so that I could freshen up. It was an awesome perk they offered me, and I very much appreciated the opportunity to shower, change and have some breakfast before heading over to the Taj Mahal. The hotel also arranged a guide for me today. Sarfaraz is a university professor with a Ph. D. in Indian History. He is the perfect guide for a day in Agra. We set out to the Taj Mahal and parked one-mile away from the gates to the compound. Because of the sensitivity of the brilliant white color of the Taj Mahal marble, you are not allowed to operate a combustion engine within one mile of the site. From here, one must walk, take an electric cart or ride on a cycle rickshaw. We chose the cycle rickshaw. Arriving To The Taj Mahal: Arriving at the outer gates of the Taj Mahal is not as overwhelming as I expected. The lines took only a few minutes to pass through, and the architecture is the exact opposite of what I thought I would find. We are all familiar with the picture of the white Taj Mahal, but what we don’t often see in photos are all the other buildings in the compound, which are made from a red stone. Though these other building are beautiful, they are not what you come here to see. The outer courtyard is a huge rectangle filled with gardens and surrounded by a low structure which houses stables, living quarters and short-term accommodations for visitors. These are all vacant today but are well preserved. In the center of each of these structures stands a large gate. Three of these gates lead to the outside of the compound while the fourth and most impressive gate leads to the main attraction. This gate is very impressive, and as you get in front of it, you catch your first glimpses of the Taj Mahal. I have been to many historical sites in my life that claim to have design features that play tricks on your eyes with scale and shape, but none have ever been this effective. In the next photo, you will see what I saw from one position. But at every step the view of the Taj Mahal drastically changes. In this photo, the Taj Mahal looks like it must be very close on the other side of the gate. Inside The Grounds of the Taj Mahal: As you pass through this gate, you get to see more and more of the Taj Mahal. It is not until you pass nearly all the way through the gate that you see the entire structure and realize that it is still several hundred meters away. The effect this has is pretty amazing and nearly induces a vertigo sensation. It’s awesome! Once inside the gate, I had to push my way past gawkers and photographers so that I could get my own photos. I took a few standard shots, walked the gardens and then went into the Taj Mahal. On the white-stone surfaces of the Taj Mahal, I had to slip booties over my feet. We walked freely around, in and throughout the structure. Above eye level, the inside of the Taj Mahal is mostly plain. Eye level and below there are many inlaid semi-precious stones cut into flowers and other shapes of nature. The guide explained to me that the use of semi-precious stones rather than precious stones was a strategic decision, not a financial one. There was a real fear and understanding that if the Taj Mahal had been built of precious materials, that it would be a more likely target for pillaging. You can hardly find a stone missing or damaged in the whole place, so I think the king made a good decision with his material choice. The Best View in Agra: At the end of the day, we drove across the river to get a backside view of the Taj Mahal. This is the rumored site for a second Taj Mahal that would have been made of black stone, but which was never built. Now this space is a beautiful rose garden, and you can find some ruined foundations. I think this view of the Taj Mahal is the best, and what makes it even better: no one else is around!

A large portion of this fort is still under active duty, but parts are open to tourists. We were at the fort for about two hours. The Agra Fort is very nice and has some similar design features and colors as we saw at the Taj Mahal. However, it is in many ways like most other palaces: gates, walls, harams, royal quarters, gardens, etc. . If you visit Agra, don’t miss the Agra Fort for sure. But after seeing the Taj Mahal it’s hard to make an impression! Just the same, here are some photos from the Fort.

    "body": "2014/10/26 - Dharamshala: The Dalai Lama represents peace and tranquility to millions throughout the world, and Dharamshala is his home in exile from Tibet. Tibetan buddhists believe he is the incarnation of the Buddha of compassion, who has long been considered to be the patron deity of Tibet. Dharamshala sits within view of the Himalayan mountains and covers the side of a very large foothill. The upper area of the town is called McLeod Ganj and is where the Dalai lama lives. Our hotel was in the town proper at the foot of the mountain. The drive from bottom to top is about half an hour up a well-paved switchback road which, ironically, mostly weaves in and out of an active military installation. At every corner, we had commandos sitting behind sandbag walls with very large guns pointed at us. Peace and tranquility indeed! The several blocks of a town which make up McLeod Ganj are beautiful and scattered with street vendors, a few temples and a a bunch of Tibetan monks. There is also a KFC and a Pizza Hut, so don’t fret. There was no sign of Hinduism here and most people looked more Asian than Indian. It really was like being in another country. The Temple of the Dalai Lama: For me, the main attraction here was to see the palace of the Dalai Lama. We were not allowed to take cameras, phones or any sort of electronic device into the palace but you can see many beautiful photos on Google. The approach to the palace is very humble; rough roads, reminders of stark poverty and unkempt street animals ranging from dogs to cows. Before you arrive to the palace, there is a checkpoint after which phones and cameras must be deposited. At the palace entrance, you meet airport-style security and through pat-downs. Once inside the palace I was free to roam around. I took my time with people watching and taking in the scenic views from the palace terraces. Many people were praying and in such a fashion that I had not seen before. The inner rooms were adorned with beautiful paintings and tapestries of Buddhist figures. Exterior walls were lined with prayer wheels.  Unfortunately, on this day the Dalai Lama was not in-residence, he was in Alabama speaking at the University of Birmingham. Though Hampi was my favorite place to visit in India, this was the most impactful. If you ever get a chance to visit here, do it. It’s a bit off the beaten path, a 15 hour drive from New Delhi, but there is an airport nearby that you can fly in to for a price. If the Dalai Lama is in residence, you can catch one of his many public teachings.  Check the Dalai Lama’s schedule to see if he will be home while you are around. Also, if you go there, I have a fantastic contact for buying the best jewels, rugs, carpets, Indian handicrafts and Tibetan paintings, and at fantastic prices.

The temperate summer climate and the snowy winters make this a very popular destination for seasonal tourism. We visited Manali in the off-season between summer and winter, so we had the place relatively to ourselves. The greatest attraction near Manali is Rohtang Pass, with an altitude of 3979m (13,050 ft). We drove up a fairly treacherous road to the pass. Once there, we rode horseback to get closer to the peak. This route is easily one of the more scenic places I have been in all of India, and it was a bucket-list check to see the Himalayas. But don’t fret! Just because we were at The Top of the World didn’t escape us from hawkers. A man came to me here trying to sell saffron. Before I could say no he grabbed my hand and put some in my hand and closed it. The smell of whatever this was (I am not convinced it was just saffron) stayed with me for days and made me nauseous. I washed my hands so many times and even bought a pound of coffee grounds to rub on my hands to get rid of this smell. It took a week to go away.

Since I am traveling solo in India, they are kind enough to invite me on a few of their weekend excursions. But due to some last minute changes in their ability to come to Bangalore, I spent most of the time touring the city on my own. As it turned out, Mutual Mobile had representatives here conducting some recruitment efforts, so I spent my first day with them interviewing candidates. After the interviews, I met up with the Deloitte crew for dinner at the City Center, followed by dancing on the City Center Rooftop lounge, Skyye, probably the best club I’ve ever been to. I didn’t stress about seeing too much in Bangalore, as my time here was short, and I just wanted to go with the flow. When I did start getting around the town, my first stop was the Bull Temple. It was a fairly typical temple in many regards, except for one: the idol is huge! In most temples, the idol on the shrine is very small, usually just 24-36 inches tall. But the bull statue resting on the altar was some 20 feet tall! Also, unlike most temples, photography of the idol was permitted here.

Of all the cultural events I attended, Dandiya was my favorite. The music seemed to be unique to this festival. I never heard music elsewhere in India with so much percussion, and, to be honest, I rarely ever heard live music of any nature, but this night made up for that. I like to describe the band as having the “correct number of drummers,” because everyone on stage was a percussionist! (keep in mind that piano is a percussion instrument; therefore a synthesizer is too!) Dandiya has a fascinating history (Wikipedia) and the modern celebration features dance performances that honor the goddess Durga by depicting a battle between the goddess and the demon-king Mahishasura. The dance is sometimes referred to as “The Sword Dance” because participants carry sticks that they twirl and strike against the sticks of other dancers while twirling. I feel that this dance has some similarities to the Brazilian martial art, Capoeira. The Best Dressed Man At Dandiya: Proper attire at this festival is a must. I was instructed that I must buy traditional clothing before I attended the event. I went to a fine tailor and asked him to give me something that says, “the party starts now,” when I walk in the door. His success in fulfilling this request was certified when I won an award for Best Dressed Man at the festival. What an honor! I went to the festival in Hyderabad with some colleagues of mine. We were invited by our new friends at Haworth, the office furniture vendor who we chose to supply all the furnishings to the new Mutual Mobile office. We danced together all night, made new friends and memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.

I’ve never enjoyed doing nothing so much in my life. Stacey and I stayed in an amazing oceanside plantation-era house converted into a “non-hotel-hotel” called The Bungalow on the Beach.  The space kept true with the colonial furnishings and decor. This house was the only place to eat in this tiny seaside town and the menu changed with the day’s catch. The local economy seems to be mostly from fishing and tourism. Everyday we sat on the porch of the hotel and watched the fishermen fish until they came to shore with their catch; our hotel got first dibs on the freshest seafood. The food was incredible. Tranquebar is famous for two things: Fort Dansborg and The Zion Church. note: Tranquebar is not famous. . the fact that Stacey (who is Indian) could not find anyone who had ever heard of Tranquebar, is the reason she wanted to go check it out in the first place. The Largest Danish Fort Outside of Europe: Fort Dansborg is a 17th century Danish fort. It is the 2nd largest Danish fort in the world and it is the largest outside of Europe. It costs USD $0. 079 to go inside. The Zion Church was built in 1701 and it is the oldest Protestant church in India. Every building around this church is also a church. Thus, from what I can tell, Tranquebar is the point of origin for Protestantism in India. The town, especially the coastline, is very photogenic.

It was a long and horn-honking experience. We arrived just in time to watch the sun rise over the Bay of Bengal, which made the tiresome journey very much worthwhile. National Holiday For Gandhi: We arrived on the morning of Gandhi Jayanti, one of only 3 recognized national holidays of India (the others are Independence Day and Republic Day). Gandhi Jayanti marks the occasion of Gandhi’s birth. There were festivities abound with music, speeches, dances, speeches, food, speeches, and oh yeah, speeches. After spending sunrise on the coast, we wandered around the historic district of the city. Pondicherry was the largest French colony in India and the architecture and “rues” made me feel a bit like I was in New Orleans. Aside from just taking in the atmosphere, there weren’t much for attractions, plus the holiday meant everything was closed anyway. After lunch, we hired a car, and we headed to Tranquebar. Read about that adventure here. Photos From Pondicherry: [gallery link=”none” ids=”3189,3188,3190,3191,3217,3192,3193,3194,3195,3196,3197,3198”] "

    "title": "Hampi the Fallen Capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in India",
    "body": "2014/09/29 - Hampi: Fallen Seat of an Empire: In south central India, in the heart of a jungle less-traveled, lies the now sleepy town of Hampi. This village was once home to over 500,000 people and in it’s time it was one of the largest cities in the world. Now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire is a mere shadow of it’s former glory, but what remains is truly breathtaking. In A Nutshell: Highlights - Hampi boasts some of the oldest, most beautiful, and well-preserved architecture in all of India. The tourism-friendly market offers a few familiar comforts to guests, without distracting from Hampi’s uniqueness. . Lowlights - The sites are too far apart from each other to walk to each of them. You will have to have a car or a tour guide who can provide transportation. Food is only available in the town center, so it is advisable to pack some food for the day. Bottom Line - Hampi is stunning! If you have any opportunity to go here, you must! If you had to choose between here and the Taj Mahal, then choose Hampi! Roadtripping to Hampi: Hampi is my favorite place in India. Period. Nowhere else has come even close. This ancient city has been left mostly in ruins despite it once being the capitol of Vijayanagar, a 14th century empire. Just imagine if Rome had been sacked and was then forgotten; that’s basically what happened to Hampi. Speaking of ‘sacked,’ that’s how our drive felt. What should have been a 7-hour drive according to Google Maps, turned out to be a 21-hour nightmare. That is partially because Google Maps lacks the data to provide accurate drive times and traffic conditions in India, and partially because we had a flat tire. And then we had. . another flat tire! I was riding to Hampi with some colleagues of mine and wea decided to drive through the night. Unfortunately, we got our second flat tire at 1am and there was no way to get assistance until more than 9 hours later. Thus, we tried to sleep, which was taxing with four large men in an economy-sized car, heat, humidity, and oh my goodness the mosquitos. As the sun rose, the area around us came alive. There was a family of boar rummaging around our car and not 100 meters from us was a little food stand with fresh breakfast. ‘Upma’ is basically grits with a kick, and was some of the best food I’ve eaten in India. It’s true, street food, especially village street food, is the best. [gallery type=”rectangular” ids=”3228,3245,3231,3230,3243,3229,3244”] The Tungabhadra Dam and a Hindu Fest: After getting our tire fixed, we continued on toward Hampi to our hotel in the nearby town of Hospet. We quickly checked in and took off again to see Tungabhadra Dam before the sunset. This dam is a 50-meter high power station which holds back a reservoir of 378 square kilometers. It’s huge. The grounds below the dam are covered by a national park, botanical gardens and a temple. The temple was celebrating Navratri, a hindu festival which, among other things, celebrates the coming of autumn. I went to the temple and experienced my first poojah. After paying respects to the idol, a pujari (Hindu priest) gave me some coconut water and a leaf filled with lemon rice and rice pudding. It was delicious. Just in case you’ve missed the subtile hints: the food is awesome. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3249,3250,3251,3252,3253,3254,3255”] The Historical Ruins of Hampi: The next morning we woke early and went to Hampi. We hired a guide and subsequently I learned a business lesson about India which would serve me very well for the rest of my time in the country. The guide wanted INR1000 to take us to five destinations around Hampi and to be with us for 6 hours. We worked him down to INR750 and off we went. Then, after just 3 hours we had finished the tour and he demanded to be paid. At this point we didn’t have leverage to not pay him the full INR750 because he had, in fact, taken us to all the places that he said he would take us. However, though we were not particularly rushed on the tour, I am curious about what did we not see or fully enjoy because he was looking to get us through Hampi quickly and pick up extra business in the afternoon. If we had not negotiated his price, then we would have either paid INR1000 for 6-hours and seen more, or we would have paid INR500 for just three hours of his time. In the end, paying INR750 for 3 hours was the most costly way to go. What this taught me about negotiating in India is that you can feel like a winner at the time of negotiation, but people always find a way to make their margins in the end. This proved to be true at every scale and every purchase that I made for the next 4 months. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3267,3266,3265,3264,3263,3262,3261,3260,3259,3258,3257,3256”] Most of the original buildings of Hampi were destroyed by the invasion of three Muslim kings in 1565, but there are a few buildings with Islamic architectural details which they left standing. Additionally, there are a few buildings they left for their own use, like the elephant stables. Very few buildings that were destroyed have been reconstructed, but as you will see from these photos, those which remain are truly beautiful. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3268,3269,3270,3271,3272,3273,3274,3275”] The central point of Hampi is marked by the very large Virupaksha Temple. The panoramic view of this temple from atop a nearby hill is breathtaking. This single structure and the view from this vantage point is the most interesting thing I saw in all of India.

    "body": "2014/09/14 - I was a child when I first visited the National Natural History Museum in Washington D. C. I’ve never been one for jewels, especially diamonds, but ever since my childhood, I’ve been captivated by the Hope Diamond, which is notorious for supposedly being cursed. The history and mystery of that stone is very interesting, and it’s origins are rather unknown, except that it was mined and originally housed just west of Hyderabad, India, at the once formidable Golconda Fort. The fort’s original buildings are over a thousand years old and have been extensively expanded over the centuries. The center of the fort rests atop a 100m-high granite hill, which is the source for many of the buildings’ stones. The outer wall is seven miles long and it’s architecture is reminiscent of European castles. The massive inner compound is similar to Disney Land, in that you could be here for a week and likely not see everything. Ascending to the top of the hill is quite the trek, but the panoramic views of the city below are stunning. As I explored the grounds of the fort, I felt like I was on a treasure hunt, imaging where the diamond once rested. It was a surreal experience to be in this place so far from home, but which had such a strong connection with one of my most vivid childhood memories. I frequented the fort while living in Hyderabad, and if ever I return to the area, I will no doubt visit here again.

    "body": "2014/09/13 - I had the most wonderful experience exploring Hyderabad today! I went to visit one of India’s most recognizable monuments, a mosque called Charminar. The name comes from combining the Urdu words Chār and Minar’, which translates to “Four Towers,” referencing the monument’s four ornate minarets. This structure is the icon of Hyderabad and is visited by thousands of people every day. Charminar is the first tourist destination I’ve visited in India and I’ve learned something: tourists and locals do not pay the same rate, not by a long shot. The local rate is 25INR, while I paid 500INR! This is less than $8USD, which is a fine amount of money to pay, but wow, what a surcharge! The one benefit to paying extra is that I also got to skip the 200-person deep line and walk straight in (though feeling at least moderately guilty about skipping). The substantial structure is adorned with intricate carvings and perfectly symmetrical Construction. However, there is hardly a spot in the whole interior which has not been graffitied with permanent etchings of people’s names and other marks. Years of paan being spit on the floor has stained the stone and there is a lingering scent which might be related. Despite that, the structure is magnificent, but in need of restoration. The views from atop Charminar are great. The way that traffic flows around the site like water around a stone is mesmerizing to watch. The busy streets below are lined with shops and street vendors, painting a very colorful landscape which includes the nearby Mecca Masjid, one of India’s oldest mosques. While taking in the view, I was constantly asked to pose in photos with other visitors to the site. being a foreigner in this part of the world made me feel like a celebrity, for better or worse. Though there was a huge language barrier with all the people I encountered, the positive energy and wishes of goodwill were universally understood. Today was a great day!

    "body": "2014/09/10 - Living high above the poverty line: I’ve now been living in Hyderabad, India, for about 3 weeks and am starting to get accustomed to my daily schedule and the opportunities presented to me here. The main purpose of my being here is for an extended stay business trip with Mutual Mobile as the project manager for developing a new office in the city for around 100 team members. More on that in a separate post as things develop. Generally speaking, I have seen three things in this city: The Trident Hotel, Charminar, and the Golkonda Fort. For the sake of brevity, I will just write about the hotel in this post. You can find my other posts from Hyderabad here. [gallery link=”none” type=”rectangular” ids=”2891,2892,2894,2895,2896”] I typically wouldn’t write about a hotel, but The Trident Hotel is my new home, so it is worth a mention. Trident is a brand new 7-star hotel in the High Tech City area of Hyderabad. The staff here are incredibly good at what they do and they don’t skip a beat to make me feel like royalty. They have even provided me with a complimentary personal trainer, Raj, who meets me 6-mornings a week in the fitness center. I have made friends with the several key staff members here who have taken me out and shown me a good time, but I still have cultivated the phrase, “I don’t need a house of servants, I need a house of friends!” The hospitality is great for a few days, but I live here now and I don’t need everyone putting me on a pedestal all the time. It is very isolating. I have started to explain this to a few people and they seem to understand where I am coming from. Only time will tell if they adjust the way they interact with me or not. Beneath my feet, the poverty runs wild: There is a strange situation I am faced with every day, and I haven’t yet figured out what I can or want to do about it. Each morning, I wake up around 6am to the dawn of a new day. I promptly order a 2-shot cappuccino (This your fault, Ed Ireson!) and some whole wheat toast from in-room dining and then start checking on emails that I received during the night from Austin. When the coffee arrives, I move to a chair that faces out the windows and overlooks this huge park called Shilparamam. So here I am, 19-floors above this beautiful scene, watching the sunrise, drinking my pretentious coffee, and my only worry is to make sure I get to the fitness center on time to meet with Raj for the day’s workout. Then, at my feet, this is what I see: I don’t know that this structure on the left is a home, but on the right is a courtyard with some running water piped in and a laundry line. You will notice the man bathing; he is usually joined by a few friends, but today he is alone, as am I. We are so close to each other but our lives are worlds apart. He bathes under a trickling stream of water, exposed to the open air in the shadows of my glass palace where I have all the comforts modern times can offer. I am no stranger to poverty. My time in Brazil and Kyrgyzstan showed me intense poverty and at times I lived right in it. Though this is a peaceful scene, I am reminded of a quote by Gandhi, “Poverty is the worst form of violence;” perhaps only because this is India and I am just cliche like that. I am deeply moved by the dichotomy of this situation but I also feel powerless to do anything about it. I can’t even measure my own feelings about the situation. My struggle in this scene is to decide, “how do I feel about this,” and “what can I do about it?” I am very interested in being part of effecting widespread change in people’s lives, but I am much more of an institutionalist than I am a one-on-one interaction type. My time working for the Louisiana Capital Area Red Cross ingrained a sense of institutional impacts being more my forte than being the one pouring the soup in the kitchen. So what do I do?: I can ignore it, but that gets no one anywhere. I can go down there and talk to the man, but about what? If I go there, what can I offer? Does my going there make any positive impact on him? Maybe he will just be bothered by me, or become more conscious of the fact that hundreds of people can watch him bathe every day. Either way, it seems like my interacting with him will be more about making me feel good about me and less about making a positive impact on him and his life. Maybe I lack the creativity to see an obvious course of action here but I hope something comes to me. I am open to suggestions; if you have any, please write them in the comments below. "

    "title": "How to Achieve Silicon Valley Anywhere [crosspost]",
    "body": "2014/06/27 - The following was originally posted on &lt;re/code&gt; on June 25, 2014. Read the original post here. If you are in the tech world, Silicon Valley is your mecca. Or at least that’s what we’re led to believe, thanks to its high concentration of technophiles and constant attention as “America’s technology capital. ” But why? Flourishing tech hubs like New York’s Silicon Alley, Austin’s Silicon Hills, and other emerging hotspots prove that Silicon Valley isn’t the only tech-friendly area. What truly makes Silicon Valley unique among its like-minded city counterparts is the close-knit community of entrepreneurs, investors and tech up-and-comers. Truth be told, there is nothing stopping other cities from cultivating that Silicon Valley community feel. Places like Austin are ripe with potential — we have the high concentration of technology companies, emerging and established technophiles, and entrepreneurs in our downtown corridor, as well as a culture that accepts and encourages innovation. The building blocks are there, but logistical issues and a downtown environment that has yet to embrace inter-company relationship building (despite being well-suited to do so) currently stand in the way of our tech community realizing this city’s true potential. In an attempt to address these social and logistical issues, my partner, Ed Ireson, and I founded the Brazos Tech District in the summer of 2013. Austin’s Brazos Street spans approximately 10 city blocks and is home to dozens of companies and more than 3,000 tech professionals. The tech district seeks to engage these individuals in a close-knit community that comes together to improve interoffice friendships and partnerships, and to solve issues that affect the group as a whole. In this year, we welcomed 10 businesses and more than 1,000 individuals into the Brazos Tech District, but more importantly we’ve learned some invaluable lessons about what it takes to successfully cultivate a tech community outside of Silicon Valley. Keep it organic: Try as you might, it’s nearly impossible to force people to participate in anything. In order to successfully create a community like the Brazos Tech District, it has to be an organic evolution; though that’s not to say that the process can’t occur without some strategic effort. It has to be planned. Proof of that came from our own city’s Chamber of Commerce, which tried to create geographic communities several years ago, but lack of direction and lack of business interest caused its plan to fail. There’s a time and a place when something is going to work; it cannot be forced. In this instance, we saw a need in our community — a lack of viable parking and transportation options for downtown tech employees — and assumed that we were not alone in this need. We provided a unique solution to a familiar pain point, and have seen community interest and involvement as a result. Identify your stakeholders early: This should go without saying, but targeting the correct stakeholders is one of the easiest ways to create a successful community. For the Brazos Tech District, it was important that we represented a specific geographic region — so important that we included that region in the organization’s name, and we stick to it. Stay true to your boundaries. Figure out what you want to achieve, how you are going to do that, and who you plan to represent, and make no exceptions. It might seem a little exclusive, but history has shown that trying to please everyone often results in pleasing no one. Keeping to your own goals is important. Not only do you need to find the right people, but you need to get them on board early, and gather people with as many diverse viewpoints as possible. While the Brazos Tech District is built around individuals within a specific geographic area of downtown Austin, it includes tech companies, churches, transportation providers and community organizations. The key is to make sure all stakeholders are helping your community to fulfill your overall needs; bringing the wrong people on board might cause everything to fall apart. Generate engagement: Building a community means nothing if you can’t get people to actually participate. It’s important to create activities that further your mission, whether it be a social mission or more logistical. At the Brazos Tech District, we have both. To satisfy the social side of things, hold weekly events that encourage members to get out of the office and come together for lunch (like our Food Truck Fridays). Ping-pong tournaments, happy hours, and bike-sharing programs are other great ways to help individuals within your community develop new friendships in the area. To further a logistical mission, team up with local infrastructure in a way that pushes your overall goals forward. We’ve teamed up with CapMetro, the local transportation authority, to find a solution to the parking nightmare that is downtown Austin. We started by providing discounted bus passes to members — which will save thousands of dollars annually for their employers, many of which subsidize downtown parking for their employees. But we’re looking to take it even further, so we’re in the process of developing an API for CapMetro so that its data can be accessed by developers. Once that is completed, we’re going to hold a hackathon so that member companies can make use of that data, and we can show Austin what can be done when communities come together. There are, of course, challenges in building this Silicon Valley-like feel. There is no management structure within the Brazos Tech District, making the need for self-motivated members extremely important. Securing approval from local companies has also been a challenge, but one that is diminishing every day. As businesses see the value that your community brings to both their employees and their bottom line, they will be more open to participation. With the Brazos Tech District, we’re only just beginning, but this last year has shown that you don’t have to live in Silicon Valley to feel a part of an established tech community. That “new Silicon Valley” is possible anywhere, so long as you have a driven group of people interested in bringing the vision to life.

Enjoy the read and thank you all for the support. On to the next adventure! View original source here: http://issuu. com/lsualumni/docs/lsuaa_fall2013LSU Alumni Magazine, Fall 2013, Volume 89, Number 3, P. 68-69 ### Greetings Tiger Nation, Serving in the United States Peace Corps these last two years has been a tremendous experience. During my two years in Kyrgyzstan I accomplished many things; too many to attempt listing here. So let me just describe the cornerstone achievement: Mobile Community Media Centers. Rural and underserved populations of Kyrgyzstan, especially women and children, have a very weak voice in the country and in society. Enabling a wider voice to this population but with a lack of social mobility and weak technological resources posed a great challenge. While working with the Kloop School of Journalism I realized that harnessing mobile technology could provide a sustainable solution. The country has well-developed cellular and data networks, and smartphones are a cheap and prevalent technology in the region. I wrote a concept note to support this project and found funding in a joint United Nations / European Union Commission program. I had close contacts at the UN who helped guide our ideas into a framework which would fulfill our mutual goals. This developed into a self-sustaining project between Kloop and the UN. A journalism and technological training series are now underway in all regions of the country and in just six-months, 10 of these Mobile Community Media Centers have been deployed into the field in addition to two new stationary Community Media Centers. Together, a great victory was achieved in supporting freedom of speech In Central Asia and the development of the press corps–both essential elements to promoting stable democracy in the region. I can’t begin to thank everyone who has made all of this possible. From those who have encouraged me throughout all the years to all of you who sent me care packages, and all of the project funders to my wonderful counterparts at RadioMost, Kloop and the Braille Literacy Project, you will all forever be a part of me. And thank you Tiger Nation for letting me share my story with you. I hope my story has inspired you to make the world we live in a better place. I have now returned to the USA and am living in Austin, TX where I am leading the charge to establish Kloop-USA. Kloop-USA is a non-profit aimed at promoting journalism and freedom of speech in Central Asia. We have short-term goals of fundraising and advocacy, and long-term goals to create study abroad opportunities for Central Asian students to study journalism in America. For more information about Kloop-USA, please visit my blog. Often when I receive feedback from people who have heard my story, they tell me things like, “I wish I could do that,” or, “I always thought about it…,” and to them I say: just do it. There is nothing special or magical about me or my story–I am just the guy who showed up, raised a hand, walked through a door and followed my heart. If Peace Corps sounds interesting to you, then call a recruiting office–you might just be surprised what all you will learn about, “The Toughest Job You’ll Ever Love. ” Yours in Service &amp; GEAUX TIGERS! Signing off–for now… Judson L MooreUS Peace Corps 2011-13RPCV, Bishkek Kyrgyzstan "

His has only 7,000 miles on it and the seats are still wrapped in the original plastic. It’s a true museum piece, it even spent a few years under the central atrium of the Corvette Museum. For this trip, we trailered the car to Kentucky, stayed at a hotel across the street from the museum and only drove the car from one side of the street to the other. The photos do the car no justice, it truly is gorgeous in person. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”4032,4034,4035,4036”] The National Corvette Museum Tour: The C4 Gathering lasted for four days and was full of information sessions about the history of Corvette, opportunities to look at the new ZO6 and Stringrays which were not yet available for purchase, concept cars, race cars and lots of opportunities to race the cars that people brought with them. And now here is what you’re really here for: car photos! [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”4040,4050,4046,4037,4038,4039,4047,4048,4041,4042,4043,4044,4045,4049,4051,4052,4053,4054,4055,4056,4057,4058,4059,4062,4063,4066”] Here is your Judson trivia factoid for the day: I grew up in Kentucky, not Louisiana. Did you already know that? If so, then you are either really paying attention, or you have known me for a very long time. I’ve not been back to Kentucky since 1999, and so while I was this close to my childhood home, my childhood best friend, Kevin, surprised me with a visit to Bowling Green! What a great trip! Are you a Corvette enthusiast? Do you own a C4? Do you want to know more about these beautiful card? Please drop me a note in the comments below, or message me directly at @judsonlmoore! "

    "title": "What to do for A Weekend in Istanbul",
    "body": "2013/05/05 - Before we get too far down the Istanbul rabbit hole of awesomeness, let me remind you that I just had a major abdominal surgery a few weeks ago and am still very much in the midst of recovering. I give a lot of thumbs ups and smiles for the camera, but I had to move really carefully and slowly through all of this. That said, please forgive me if I tended to not do my hair. I would also love to hear from you about your past or future time spent in Istanbul. Please share your story in the comments below or by messaging me directly at @judsonlmoore! Naziia accompanied me on this trip and it was an amazing honeymoon of sorts. She really made this trip possible by getting us hooked up at one of her friend’s homes in the beautiful Florya neighborhood of Istanbul. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3761,3762,3763,3764”] The 6-hour flight was perfectly manageable under normal circumstances, but we departed in the middle of the night and I didn’t travel well having to sit for so long with my healing body. We landed, got through customs and hailed a cab to Naziia’s friend’s house. After getting settled in and cleaned up, we went exploring around the neighborhood. Florya is a rather wealthy neighborhood and home to the famous sports club Galatasaray SK, a number of airline headquarters and the summer home of past Turkish President Atatürk. This area also housed more carpet retailers than the census could count and had I been traveling onward to a large home in America, I would have certainly bought a carpet here; the tapestries were of incredible design and quality, with unbeatable prices. We decided to head toward the city center to check out the infamous architecture of Istanbul. Along the way, I got stopped dead in my tracks when I saw something I hadn’t seen in years: the holy temple of mediocre but consistently dependable coffee: STARBUCKS! [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3765,3766”] Once I dug myself out of the shame I instantly felt for succumbing to the corporate coffee, I needed to see something real, and really old. Luckily, we were right around the corner from the Grand Bazaar. Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar: The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world. The bazaar encompasses over 60 covered streets and with its 3000+ shops, it’s truly a maze of wonder. The Grand Bazaar is also the single most visited tourist attraction in the world, hosting over 90 million annual visitors. You can find just about anything here, but what really stood out to me were the many gold and textile merchants. Gold is prominent as a fashion material, like many parts of the world, but its real merit here was as an investment. Traditionally, gold holds it’s value through economic strife, regime change, etc. . and is therefore perceived as a great investment to own in very specific weights and qualities.  Since I have no need or desire for gold pieces, I spent more time focused on the textile merchants. Though what they have here is beautiful and might even be reasonably priced, I couldn’t very well allow myself to make a textile purchase in Turkey after making no such purchases in Kyrgyzstan. I left empty handed, but I did enjoy my first truly authentic Turkish coffee and stepped back into the daylight feeling both reenergized and redeemed. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3770,3771,3772,3773,3774,3775,3776”] The Hagia Sophia: Built around 500AD, the Hagia Sophia was the largest cathedral in the world for nearly 1000 years and is the greatest achievement of Byzantine architecture.  It was converted to a mosque around 500 years ago and now functions primarily as a museum. The interior of the structure is made from a black and white marble which makes everything at eye level dark, forcing your attention upward to the massive gilded dome reflecting outside light. Though the Hagia Sophia’s architecture feels like a mosque, it was originally built as an orthodox church. Its architectural style has had such an impact that its design influenced the construction of more modern mosques, such as the nearby Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque) from which many mosques around the world are fashioned today. [gallery type=”rectangular” ids=”3957,3959,3956,3962,3960,3953,3954,3955,3958,3963”] The Blue Mosque: The Sultan Ahmed Mosque, known as the Blue Mosque of Istanbul, is an architectural marvel to behold. Anyone who stands in the presence of this building will likely be inspired, but you may also be confused. The confusion I refer to is that you may notice the lack of blueness in the mosque’s outward appearance. Indeed, the Blue Mosque is known as such not because of it’s exterior coloring, but because of it’s distinct interior design where more than 200,000 handmade İznik style ceramic tiles create vast mosaics. I arrived at the Blue Mosque first thing in the morning and still had an hour or so wait before I could enter. I encourage you to also get there as early as possible. Upon entry, I received a plastic bag for my shoes and then I had free reign of the place. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3973,3971,3964,3965,3972,3966,3974,3967,3968,3969,3970,3975,3976,3977,3978,3979”] Upon exiting the Blue Mosque, we ran into a film shoot for a Bollywood film. We stayed and watched for a few minutes before carrying on.  Update: While living in Hyderabad India (two years after being in Istanbul), I showed this clip to some colleagues and they recognized it instantly. What we saw being filmed can be seen in its final cut at 1:35 in this video featuring Jeet &amp; Subhasree. The Obelisk of Theodosius: A stone’s throw from Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque rests The Obelisk of Theodosius.  Carved originally from a single 30m long section of red granite around 1450BC, this obelisk is a relic of the temple of Karnak and has been in Istanbul for 1600 years. Istanbul has a reputation for being the most cosmopolitan city in the world. From this vantage point, you can see architecture which merges Egyptian, Ottoman, Anglican and Arab cultures from throughout the millennia, a view which is truly not available in many other places in the world. Topkapı Palace: Topkapı Palace was the seat of the once great Ottoman Empire for over 400 years. Its location at the mouth of the Bosphorus River makes it strategically significant as all vessels traveling between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea would have to pass right by here. The palace’s location made it formidable, but more importantly, it was important for the nearby trade routes, giving access to the Ottoman leaders. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”3989,3981,3980,3983,3982,3984,3985,3986,3987,3988,3990,3991,3992,3993,3994,3999,3995,3996,3997,3998”] Mısır Çarşısı (Egyptian Bazaar): Also known as the Spice Bazaar, the Mısır Çarşısı (Egyptian Bazaar) is quite likely the most delicious smelling place I have ever been. This massive sprawl of mostly spice and tea vendors sell their quality products in an open-air fashion which fills the air, and your nostrils, with wonderful smells. If this is a glimpse into what Egypt is like, then I can not wait to get there someday soon!  Update: I have now been to Egypt! Check out those stories here. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”4001,4002,4003”] Walls of Constantinople: Much like the Great Wall of China, the Walls of Constantinople are not a single wall but a massive system of walls. Built in the 4th century, these walls made Constantinople (Istanbul) impenetrable for nearly a millennium. Though left mostly in ruins today from centuries of neglect, there are still many standing sections with open public access. Restoration efforts have been underway in some spots since the 1980’s, but for our part, it was difficult to tell if we were looking at restored walls or simply masterful craftsmanship that has lasted for 1600 years. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009,4010,4012,4013,4014”] For anything else we did not have time (nor I the health) to see in Turkey, we let Miniaturk fill in the gaps. This small amusement park of miniaturized models of famous Turkish destinations is like a putt-putt golf course, but without the golf part. It is very well put together, but I sure would have preferred to see all these sites in real life. Of course, now I have a good impression of what else I can see in Turkey next time, and that actually makes this a pretty brilliant marketing outlet. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”4015,4016,4017,4018,4019,4020,4021,4022,4023,4024,4025,4026,4027,4028,4029”] Did I miss something? What is your favorite thing from Istanbul?

    "body": "2013/05/05 - Serving with the United States Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan these last two years has been a tremendous experience. During my two years in Kyrgyzstan I accomplished many things; too many to attempt listing here. So let me just describe the cornerstone achievement: Mobile Community Media Centers. Rural and underserved populations of Kyrgyzstan, especially women and children, have a very weak voice in the country and in society. Enabling a wider voice to this population but with a lack of social mobility and weak technological resources posed a great challenge. While working with the Kloop School of Journalism I realized that harnessing mobile technology could provide a sustainable solution. The country has well-developed cellular and data networks, and smartphones are a cheap and prevalent technology in the region. I wrote a concept note to support this project and found funding in a joint United Nations / European Union Commission program. I had close contacts at the UN who helped guide our ideas into a framework which would fulfill our mutual goals. This developed into a self-sustaining project between Kloop and the UN. A journalism and technological training series are now underway in all regions of the country and in just six-months, 10 of these Mobile Community Media Centers have been deployed into the field in addition to two new stationary Community Media Centers. Together, a great victory was achieved in supporting freedom of speech In Central Asia and the development of the press corps–both essential elements to promoting stable democracy in the region. I can’t begin to thank everyone who has made all of this possible. From those who have encouraged me throughout all the years to all of you who sent me care packages, and all of the project funders to my wonderful counterparts at RadioMost, Kloop and the Braille Literacy Project, you will all forever be a part of me. I hope my story has inspired you to make the world we live in a better place. I have now returned to the USA and am living in Austin, TX where I am leading the charge to establish Kloop-USA. Kloop-USA is a non-profit aimed at promoting journalism and freedom of speech in Central Asia. We have short-term goals of fundraising and advocacy, and long-term goals to create study abroad opportunities for Central Asian students to study journalism in America. For more information about Kloop-USA, please stay tuned to my website. Often when I receive feedback from people who have heard my story, they tell me things like, “I wish I could do that,” or, “I always thought about it…,” and to them I say: just do it. There is nothing special or magical about me or my story–I am just the guy who showed up, raised a hand, walked through a door and followed my heart. If Peace Corps sounds interesting to you, then call a recruiting office–you might just be surprised what all you will learn about, “The Toughest Job You’ll Ever Love. ” "

    "title": "Appendectomy In Bishkek",
    "body": "2013/04/18 - A Fair Warning The following is an account of my appendectomy which was performed in Kyrgyzstan. Due to the medical and at times gruesome nature of this story, I have chosen to omit a few details and spare the public of some photography. That said, there may still be a few details here not suitable for queazy stomachs. You’ve been warned. Read on at your own risk. Day 1 Today I woke up around 5am with some mild abdominal pain. I didn’t think too much of it but by 7am the pain was a bit more alarming. I contacted the Peace Corps Medical Officer (PCMO), who told me he would come immediately. I, like most people, enjoy hot showers. Though as my closest friends know, it might be more correctly described as a fetish. So to help make me feel better until the doctor arrived I stood in the shower, but by the time he got there just 20 minutes later, I was barley able to stand at all. When the doctor arrived he gave me a quick examination and decided to take me to the Peace Corps office to the Medical Unit for additional examination. We have a 0-10 scale for pain.  We were not at the office for long until my pain moved from a 3/4 to a solid 6. We left immediately to a nearby specialty diagnosis center. On the way to the clinic the pain sharpened; fluctuating between a 6 and a 9. (I never give anything a “perfect” or maximum score, but this could have qualified for a 10, especially on the bumpy roads) At the diagnostics center I had two exams: some sort of electronic scan, not an MRI or CAT Scan, but something else, and an EKG. With results in-hand, the doctor and I went to the National Surgical Center (hospital) where he had a team of surgeons already on standby for our arrival. The PCMO had worked at this hospital for several years and knew all the surgeons and administrators very well. The surgeons quickly chaperoned me in to an exam room and prodded around on my abdomen  Flipped me one way, then the other. Kept poking. “Does that hurt?” “YES!” The diagnosis was made: Appendicitis. Absolute textbook, classic appendicitis. And an appendectomy was recommended to be made immediately. Now I should take a moment to explain that as a Peace Corps Volunteer I have access to some of the best healthcare that I will ever have access to unless I become President or a Congressman. The Peace Corps medical team, their procedures, resources and truly global network of facilities they can send me to on a moment’s notice are all remarkable. In the case of Kyrgyzstan volunteers, when we need medical attention that a local facility can not accommodate (or does not meet the Peace Corps’ stringent requirements), then volunteers are medivaced to Thailand. This is the holy grail for PCVs. All of us secretly hope to get sick enough to get a trip to Thailand but not sick enough to remove us from service. Unfortunately, an appendix teetering on the edge of bursting does not wait for the flight to Thailand, so headquarters sent word for me to have the procedure done locally. Bummer. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: What follows in the following days’ posts might come off as critical. In fact, much of it is. I outline some shortcomings of my care and the facilities, but I don’t want this to be misconstrued as statements that I believe Kyrgyz doctors to be incompetent. Rather, I hope to show that the medical staff’s skills are quite good, considering their access to resources. It is the resources and facilities which are lacking. Not the surgical skill of the team who worked on me. OK, you’ve been warned (again). Keep reading. Here is a photo gallery of my surgical prep experience. I was not able to take pictures inside the surgical ward but the conditions were much cleaner. Still, the facilities were very lacking. See how the room used for surgery prep more closely resembles a rundown janitor’s closet? The shelves of buckets are full of cleaning chemicals and also store the highly rusted razors that the doctors wanted to shave my stomach with. Horrifying. Upon seeing the razors, however, the PCMO left to buy new razors and shaving cream. This is only one example of why having the PCMO service is so critical. He knew he could get a better resource and went to get it. But being left alone in this janitor’s closet was one of the most terrifying moments of the ordeal as I contemplated what was about to happen to me… [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”2253,2257,2258,2255,2259,2254”] I was led to the surgical area but the PCMO was not allowed to enter the surgery room. After coming inside, the surgeons starting to ask me all these really important questions like if I had any allergies to medicine. if I had allergies to any of these specific medicines, what is my weight and height (I don’t even know in metric!) and on and on. These were things that I believe they needed to know but to which I had no answers. This begins the terrifying period of my being truly alone in this hospital. Here I am about to undergo what is already a scary event in one’s life, and I am all alone, counting on my foreign language skills and in a room that Western horror movies would love to gain access to for any climatic scene. Nothing has been updated since Soviet times, I think. Even the large, maneuverable light above the operating table which should offer crystal-clear light for the surgeons had 4 burnt-out bulbs (from 12) and the remaining 8 were not exactly blinding. That’s the last thing I saw before I woke up choking on a plastic tube. Day 1. Part 2. I start to come out of my drug-induced coma with 2 very uncomfortable realizations: 1) my hands are strapped down; 2) my throat has a intubation tube down it. Certainly I have no criticism of being intubated. That’s part of it. But it was somehow a surprise. I just wasn’t told before what to expect coming out of surgery and this was a new experience. In part of my shock I bit down, and then released the tube, which is in 2 parts. One part goes all the way in, the other part just comes within the teeth. When I released my bite, the short part fell down to the back of my throat and sat on my tonsils. This freaked me out and gave the sensation of suffocating, though I imagine the other tube would have prevented that, medically speaking. But this was very very uncomfortable and made me think, “is this what water-boarding feels like?” The nurses realized I was coming-to fairly quickly and came to me… but not to my aid. With my hands strapped I couldn’t signal anything and as I tried to use my hands to signal something about pain and not being able to breath, they just tightened me down. My left hand went numb it was so tight. The 2-5 minutes it took to un-incubate me and free my hands did of course seem like forever. But once I could breath on my own again I really didn’t have any complaints. The pain killers still had hold of me. After some time, maybe a long time, maybe not a long time, I really don’t know, the PCMO, came to my side. He immediately checked that I was responsive and told me the good news that the operation had been successful. He informed me that I was in the ICU and would stay here overnight. He would not be permitted to stay here and asked if I needed anything. I only needed my phone and to know the time. The time was 830pm. All of my personal items had been taken back to the Peace Corps office so I couldn’t have them at that time but he would bring them in the morning. This is a bummer because now I had no way to contact friends, family, or to send the pre-drafted email to a very important appointment I had at that very moment and had the foresight to write an email explaining the circumstances in the case I would not be up to making the conference call, but without my phone, I couldn’t send the message. I despise no-show no-calls and now I was one. I know this should seem like a mild reason for distress considering the circumstances, but it was all I could think about: powerless in the ICU, unable to communicate to the person next to me or a person half a world away, and being undependable at the same time. All huge stressors. Of course with time, the folks wondering why I didn’t show up did forgive me, I just wish the doctors had given me more reasonable expectations that I would be knocked out for 8 hours instead of just “a few” hours. I don’t have photos of the ICU but it was a fairly large room with 6 beds and a nurses desk. The decor and condition is the same as all the other hospital photos so it shouldn’t take too much imagination. The best story I can tell from the ICU is that I requested a container to urinate in, which they gave me, but after 30 minutes of trying it was a no-go. The nurse took it from me and gave the same container to the guy in the next bed right after it had been between my legs. Not exactly a best-practice for sanitation. Sleep was a welcome distraction to the pain which started to creep in, but these nurses have a talent for loudness. All night I heard laughter, sounds of breaking glass or other objects hitting the floor, Beyoncé ring tones and car horns from the open window right above my bed. Day 2 Around the time I was finally resting in the ICU I was abruptly interrupted by two nurses poking at my stitches. I didn’t really feel it, the drugs were still in my system, but it was enough to wake me. Then they pulled up a gurney next to my bed and instructed me to brace for impact, this was going to hurt. And boy did it hurt when I moved to the other bed. That was more awakening than a Starbucks redshot and gave me an appreciation for how Harry Whittington must have felt when Dick Cheney shot him in the face with a shotgun. Once nestled into my wheeled platform, I had no choice but to watch the ceiling lights zoom by, or at least the light fixtures, as many of them didn’t actually have bulbs in them. After a few turns down not very lengthy hallways we entered a room. My room. My “lux” room. The room is painted mint green. Glossy. White floors. Windows at one end, the door at the other. There is a bathroom and a sink. Next to the bed were 2 small tables and a chair for a guest. The bed was pretty comfortable but the blanket they covered me with was excessively heavy and I could not bear the weight on my stomach. There is no TV. No radio. No internet. No telephone. And no nurse call button. Once they closed that door, I was isolated and happy to be alone to finally rest in silence…. …until… … I wake up. Seems like it’s time for bathroom attempt: round 2. But I can’t get out of bed myself. I still don’t have my phone. There is no nurse call button. So I improvise by using all my strength to bang on the concrete wall and clap my hands. I still don’t have any voice. Every movement hurts, but nothing hurts as much as trying to speak; the pressure of my diaphragm on the operated area is too much to bare. This continues for an honest half hour or more before another patient’s family member walk by my room and hears me. She opens the door, I implore her to get a nurse and one does come right away. I tell her what I need, and off we go. Here is some humor for you: the surgical team retained my hospital gown and as I had no other clothes, I’m just naked for the rest of the day. Everyone kept yelling at me as I lay in bed, naked, asking me where my clothes are and why am I not wearing them. The only answer I had for them was, “I don’t know!” Somewhere in here I was visited by the PCMO, but as he had left my personal belongings in the Peace Corps office after my operation, and he had come directly from home this morning, he did not have my clothes or phone at this time. I was told I would have to wait for him to return in the evening. This means yet another 8 hours of waiting to call my friends and family to let them know that I am ok. The rest of the day was a series of doctor visits to poke me and me trying different clapping methods to get the attention of nurses. Eventually my voice started to come back and I could just scream. Still it hurt like hell but it yielded the desired results faster than clapping seemed to. At every visit and every assisted trip to the bathroom, there I was, in my birthday suit as I had come into the world. The nurses were more embarrassed about it than I was; I don’t get too shy around medical professionals. Still, I would have preferred some clothing. In the late afternoon I was astonished by a visit from my girlfriend, Naziia! After not hearing from me for 24-hours she was worried sick and came to the hospital herself. After dealing for hours with hospital administrators, security and nurses, she finally found where I was. It wasn’t a problem of her being restricted access to me, it was a problem of no one in the hospital knowing who I was or that I was even there. She ended up going door to door throughout the hospital until she found me. It took her about 3 hours! Naziia is amazing. From this moment, she didn’t leave my side for the next 3 days. She even slept on the cold floor of the hospital and helped me with everything. She only left me to get nurses or food. She was my ambassador during my time of greatest need and I will always be in her debt for it. Not long after Naziia found me, the PCMO came back and he brought me my personal items. I immediately switched on my phone and called my parents. Their professional background is in the medical environment so they never had too much concern about me as an appendectomy has been a “basic surgery” for a very long time. But still, it was surgery and they were worried since more than 30-hours had passed and no one had contacted them. I put a positive light on everything and told them everything is perfect, there were no problems, I just hadn’t been able to get a call out. They appreciated the update and let me get back to rest. I want to say right now that this whole experience was uncomfortable, but hey, surgery is. But the time, the better part of 24 hours when I was alone, without an advocate, without my phone, without a translator, was TERRIFYING. Not having the strength to take care of myself and not having full confidence in my understanding of what people were telling me was just awful. If there is a real complaint to make here, it is this point. To be left alone in these conditions with no way to call for help and also for my family to have not been contacted and updated on my status, is totally unacceptable. The PCMO also brought me some food stuffs. He brought bottled water, yogurt, crackers and juice. Not much but it was something. At this point it was enough. I haven’t eaten anything at all in over 48-hours. Resting efforts came and went. Around 19:30 a woman burst into the room to mop the floors. That wasn’t awesome. But after she left the only other interruption I had was a nurse to stick me in the butt with something that would help me sleep. And it sure was good at that. Day 3 and Beyond The rest of my days in the hospital were pretty similar. Every day I had a little more mobility and little less pain than the day before. The schedule in this place runs pretty smoothly: 0600 - Wake up0715 - Morning IV drip of antibiotics0745 - Morning mopping of room0800 - Surgical doctors make their rounds (poke me)0830 - Breakfast1000 - Bandages changed1300 - Lunch1400 − 1600 - No visitors in hospital. Door are locked. 1800 - Dinner1930 - Evening mopping of room2000 - Evening IV drip of antibiotics2100 - Shot in the butt to help me sleep2200 - Sleep On Day 3 I didn’t do anything else. I just stayed in bed as much as possible and read news articles and listened to music on my iPhone. The iPhone 5 that Naziia bought me a week earlier. Have I mentioned yet how awesome she is? And this device is so nifty in situations like sitting in the hospital. It even tracked my location with pinpoint accuracy. The photo shows my room’s location in the hospital Day 4 I was called out of my room in the morning and told to chase after this nurse. I could barely lift my head while walking. Chasing just wasn’t in me. She led me to the worst place imaginable: the stairs! “Ok. It’s Day 4. I can do this!” And of course I did do it. I was wobbly but I did the stairs and it wasn’t so bad. Slow, but the pain was minimal. She took me to join a large group of waiting people outside of a room labeled “УЗИ” which means “ultrasound. ” She waited with me a few minutes and then urgently took off. She told me to wait here and she would be back in 10 minutes. I stood and stood and I hurt and hurt. This was getting a bit much and after more than an hour of waiting and seeing no sign of her or any additional progress in the line I gave up and went back to my room. I collapsed on my bed but was almost immediately called for again by a doctor. “Great, I have to go back down there now,” I thought, but it wasn’t true. I only had to go across the hall to an exam room. I was laid out on the table and the sharp and shiny type of instruments appeared. I told them, “you know I didn’t get the ultrasound, right?!” And they said, “oh, no? It’s ok, we can do this without that. ” I still don’t know what they did but I know I didn’t appreciate the either unnecessary ultrasound or the impatience of the doctors to just ignore whatever information the ultrasound was meant to reveal. I went back to my room but after a bit I got up the courage to try the stairs again. Mostly because I was out of units on my phone and I heard rumors I could add units on the first floor. Which was true. There was also the hospital cafeteria where I ate my first “real food. ” It was chicken samsa and oromo, typical Kyrgyz food and the only thing available in the hospital cafeteria other than fried bread. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”2268,2269”] Day 5 Naziia went to my house and brought me some books, my laptop and my hard drive with my movie collection. Also on this day Peace Corps catered lunch to my room. It was the first flavorful food I have had since the surgery. My country director, Seth Fearey, also visited me this day. In his 3 years in Kyrgyzstan I am only the 2nd in-country surgery. Usually everyone is flown off to Thailand and so he doesn’t get to visit sick volunteers. His visit was truly meaningful to me. I have always held him in the highest respect (his life story is incredible) and he is a genuine and good man. We have always gotten along and he has always been there for me. Delivering food in the hospital, and oh yea, some really interesting books I requested as well, just adds to the pile of reasons why I think Seth is amazing and I will always appreciate him. My colleagues from Kloop also visited me today and brought me oranges. My closest colleague, Aikol, was the only one allowed into the hospital because actually her dad is a surgeon here. She found my room and then we walked together to the emergency room lobby where my colleagues awaited me. They also came because they needed to get my apartment keys. We were to receive a distinguished international guest the next morning, a radio journalism trainer from Deutsche Welle, and he was staying at my apartment. It needed to be cleaned and of course I was in no condition to do it my self! See? Even from a hospital bed I am taking care of business and receiving foreign guests! I am a very productive and efficient person! [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”2272,2270,2271”] Day 6 Everything started as usual and then I had a morning visitor! Nadezhda, my new neighbor but long-time friend paid me a visit. And she brought me a cool stuffed-animal of my appendix’s soul. Halarious. Peace Corps brought me lunch again. Again typical Kyrgyz food, but it’s from the best Kyrgyz restaurant in the country. And I love that place. But I am really getting tired of the lack of variety. Just the same, the food was awesome, and Peace Corps is awesome. The rest of the day was spent just meandering the halls of the hospital. I took photos of everything that seemed interesting. Here check out these digs. And for those of you in the West, the next time you complain about the price of healthcare, know that this is what happens with the money, investment and regulation isn’t around. [gallery type=”rectangular” link=”none” ids=”2296,2295,2294,2293,2292,2291,2290,2289,2288,2287,2286,2285,2284,2283,2282,2280,2279,2278,2277,2276,2275,2274,2281”] Day 7 I finally am checking out of this place! Woo hoo! I can not express how happy I am to be on my way. The PCMO told me yesterday he would come around 11am. I sent him a SMS asking if we can stop at Sierra coffee on the way home. It is on the way to my house. He only responded with, “I come at 1315. ” Sad face. But what’s a few more hours then? I pack my things and am ready to go well in advance and spend the time reading. The sun is out for the first time this whole week and it looks like a beautiful day. I can’t wait to go outside. It will be the first time for me to be outside for a whole week. Like clockwork, the PCMO walks through my door at 1315 with the Peace Corps driver. He instructs the driver to help carry my things and instructs me to follow the driver out to the car. The PCMO worked here for 5 years so he just needs to say hello to a few people. I fully appreciate the politics and the importance of keeping relationships up. This whole thing started and finished with the hospital’s best offerings of VIP service and I am certain that the PCMO’s personal connection with the hospital had an influence on that. Waiting at the car with the driver was awful. Not because of the driver, but because of the pain. The driver is great, I like him a lot. Walking out of the hospital was a long and downward slopping driveway and then a good distance more to the car and now I hurt a little. Standing hurt, sitting in the car also hurt. Getting in and out of the car was the worst. We waited for more than half an hour before the PCMO came. Maybe closer to one hour. I asked again if we could go to Sierra. After all, it was well after lunch and I have not eaten today. I was told there had been time, but now there was no time and they just had to take me home. We drove right past Sierra, it was so depressing. Arriving home to no food in the house and being left alone I decided that the best thing to do was to order pizza, which I did. And it was amazing. I never order pizza. In 2 years living in Kyrgyzstan this is maybe only the 3rd time I have ordered pizza. So after the week I have had, this is the treat I give to myself. A bargain at 10-times the price. I ate it until I fell into a food coma, which was the perfect way to welcome myself home after a week of terrifying misery. "

In Kyrgyzstan, celebrations typically include cultural performances of music and dance. This video is from the Turkish-Manas Kyrgyz University in Djal, outside of Bishkek. What is really great about this video is its showcasing of a wide variety of performances from throughout Central Asia. Though many performances here are not native to the Kyrgyz people, they are all very popular in this country and are widely practiced and performed amongst youth. Thus, in this single event, I was able to capture a wide range of performances which will demonstrates nearly all of the music and dances which I have come to admire in Central Asia. I hope you will enjoy it as well. My favorite is the men’s dance from the Caucasus. It starts around the 10 minute mark. [There are many photos which I took from this day at this event and at the capital’s downtown festivities. At the time of this posting, I am unable to upload those photos but intend to update this post within a few days to include those images as well. ] And here are a bunch of photos. "

There is still so much work to be done and precious few hours left to accomplish it all. I still have two months until I will leave Kyrgyzstan, so this also just doesn’t feel like goodbye, even though the topic of the conference is exactly that. We share stories with each other and with staff about our experiences as Peace Corps volunteers. In particular, we provide feedback about how future groups can be more impactful than we were.  We reminisce about our beginnings as a group and all we have gone through. Regardless of if we were close to each other these last two years or not, we all relate to one another’s stories of struggle and success. I will be forever grateful for this time and for all the people I came in contact with, especially the rest of the K-19 group.

View original source here: http://issuu. com/lsualumni/docs/lsuaa_spring2013 Greetings Tiger Nation, I hope the start of 2013 is fulfilling all of your hopes and dreams! The holiday season in Kyrgyzstan was, strangely, both very familiar and very new. Bringing in the new year was quite a spectacular series of events. Unlike in America, New Year’s Eve is a formal family affair. Imagine combining Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year all together: Santa Clause (Father Frost) and his grand daughter deliver presents to children on New Years Eve, every house has a New Year’s Tree decorated almost exactly as westerners would expect to find a Christmas tree and at midnight there are fireworks and champaign to bring it all to a close. All of this is celebrated with family; friends rarely get into the mix. New Year’s Eve started off like a usual day until I heard the sound of a marching band (unheard of around here) passing my window playing Jingle Bells! I looked outside and saw a parade of hundreds of Santas, clowns and city officials. Every year, the mass of characters parades from the main square to city hall where the mayor dishes out presents to the parade participants. Then the parade turns around and returns to the main square where children (mostly orphans and top students) await and are delivered the presents. At midnight, fireworks abounded. I live only two blocks from the main square so going there to see the fireworks was easy. One major difference was that alongside the city-sponsored fireworks were an equal amount of personal fireworks being set off, which was not entirely safe, but no one seemed hurt in the process. I have no resolutions to declare as I subscribe to the philosophy of “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it!” And things so far are going just fine. January 7th was Orthodox Christmas. I wrangled up about 15 foreign friends and we went to the Bishkek Orthodox Cathedral to observe the holiday service. While I waited for the service to begin, I took in the vast collection of artwork and relics of the church. I also took some time to light a few prayer candles and send up some wishes to a few folks. I lit a candle for my mom, dad, Dezmond Meeks (my best friend and up-and-coming musician) and Alice Suzanne Harrington (newborn daughter of my friends Eddie and Emily Harrington, LSU’06 and LSU’09). As the main event was about to get started, I met a Russian guy who spoke English and was well-versed in everything related to the church. He was kind enough to stay with us for the duration of the event and explain what was going on. He also gave us the expectation that this would last not less than five hours and we would stand the whole time. Of course this makes me quite appreciative for the 1-hour church services where we get to sit in America!

    "body": "2013/03/06 - Just considering that I would begin this post with something like, “I don’t know how important it is to tell you that…” should be a pretty clear indicator, but for the sake of documentation, and most importantly, to let you all know that I am OK, let me tell you a little about my Saturday evening. Saturday was the birthday celebration of a close colleague and friend of mine from Kloop Media, Ilya. Starting with dinner and drinks at his house, we quickly moved on to a nice dance club in Bishkek called Promzona. After what seems like an unreasonably short period of time we decided to change venues to a downtown dance club where I decided not to stick around and that I was tired and wanted to go home. I was tired of paying for taxis and I was very near my new apartment so I decided to walk. The weather was nice. Sparing you the details, just as I arrived to my apartment building, 2 drunk guys started talking to me. I ignored them and moved past them. As I moved passed them I was struck in the back of my head and neck and fell to the ground. I got up and ran into a nearby 24-hour cafe where I handed my phone to a waitress as it called the Peace Corps emergency number. As she took the phone, I lost consciousness.  Actually, I don’t remember the attack at all because of the minor concussion I received. No, I was not drunk and alcohol was quickly ruled out as a contributing factor. The drinks I had at dinner were light and many hours earlier. I have only been able to put this story together by interviewing witnesses and making a few speculations. Peace Corps medical staff arrived to the scene within minutes and checked me out. I regained consciousness by the time they arrived, though I don’t remember that either. I was examined at the cafe and then shuffled off to the hospital for a series of tests. I was taken to the Peace Corps office for overnight observation where I woke up at 10am not having a clue why I was there or how I got there; even though I walked myself in without any help. After waking up I was examined again and taken home to rest, which I did for 2 days. I want to thank the staff of Arafat Cafe who gave me assistance in my time of need. They were great! (and their food is awesome!) Thank you to Naziia who I was on the phone with when the incident occurred and who also showed up to the scene within minutes. And of course thank you to the amazing level of care provided by the Peace Corps medical staff and the support of the rest of the Peace Corps staff. Lesson learned? “I am tired of paying for taxi’s so I am just going to walk. ” Money might not buy happiness, but being cheap can apparently get you killed! Next time I am taking a taxi! PS: Sorry for the cheesy stock photo. I have to associate each post with SOME photo, and I don’t have anything more relevant… "

    "body": "2013/03/06 - The culmination of months of work, preparation and an international team overcoming very difficult situations get’s summed up nicely in this article posted on the UNESCO-Kazakhstan website. Though I am not mentioned here, my work site, Kloop Media, and my director, Rinat Tykhvanshin, are. I will let it speak for it’s self. The text below was originally posted here: http://www. unesco. kz/new/en/unesco/news/2725/ The power of community media was clearly evident in Bishkek on 20 February, as 100 participants from throughout the country gathered to mark the International Day of Social Justice in Kyrgyzstan. The conference was organized within the EU-UN joint programme “Operationalizing Good Governance for Social Justice in Kyrgyzstan. “ The three-year, USD five million project, brings together the work of UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women and UNESCO in this EU-backed project to improve seven basic services in 30 villages, ayl okmotu in Kyrgyz. UNESCO leads the community media component of the project, building dialogue between national media and local communities on the one hand, and between communities and local administration on the other. UNESCO will launch six community radio stations in six regions of the country; in addition, two mini community multimedia centres (CMCs) are already operational in the Chui region, not far from the country’s capital. The CMCs have received training and technical support from UNESCO’s partner in the project, Kloop Media Foundation, Bishkek. In their remarks at the 20 February conference, Deputy Prime Minister Kamila Talieva and UN Resident Coordinator Alexander Avanessov both noted specifically UNESCO’s contribution to the improvement of village life through community media. “We note that the important work of UNESCO in bringing community radio to the ayl okmotu. The government needs to learn more about what is happening at the local level and we look forward to participating in the dialogue with citizens about their problems,” noted the Deputy Prime Minister. One highlight of the conference was the vivid presentation on the CMC project from Kloop Media Foundation, showing the local reporting already underway in the villages by young correspondents. Topics include school under population, lack of preschool facilities and sports facilities for youth, hazardous waste removal. Rinat Tykhvanshin, New Technologies Manager for Kloop Media Foundation emphasized that the young correspondents see these problems at home every day. Through community reporting and posting of their stories Kloop’s website and through Kloop’s network of affiliated media, the whole country becomes aware of their plight and a national dialogue can begin. Sergey Karpov, UNESCO Almaty Communication and Information Officer, gave a mini-master class to conference participants on aspects of communication for development, showing them the importance for of reporting on social issues at the individual level, giving a voice to vulnerable groups, and the value of community dialogue in achieving social justice.

    "title": "Merry Christmas (Russian Orthodox)",
    "body": "2013/01/07 - January 7th is the date of Orthodox Christmas. For a long and detailed explanation of why this differs from the western-celebrated December 25th Christmas you can refer to this article on Wikipedia. My friend Dimity instructed me to the time and place where the Orthodox observance of Christmas could be witnessed in Bishkek and I wrangled up about 15 other foreign friends and we went to the Bishkek Orthodox Cathedral together at 8pm to take it all in. We were instructed that the ceremony would begin when the first stars appeared in the sky. Locally that was a little before 8pm. However, the rule actually applies to when the first starts appear of Israel, not where the local church stands. So at 11pm the ceremony began. While we waited we took in the vast collection of artwork and relics in the church. I also took some time to light a few prayer candles and send up some wishes to a few folks. I lit a candle from my mom, dad, Dezmond Meeks and Alice Suzanne Harrington (newborn daughter of my friends Eddie and Emily Harrington). And yes Dezmond, I put yours on the highest place of the most elaborate and jewel-adorned place available! As the main event was about to get started, we stood in two rows outside in the cold waiting for this bishop to walk from another part of the church compound into the main church, blessing us along the way. While standing in line I met a Russian guy named Eugene who spoke quite good English and was well-versed in everything that was going on. He was kind enough to stay with us for the duration of the event and explain what was going on. He also gave us the expectation that this would last not less than five hours. Of course this makes me quite appreciative for the maximum-1-hour church services where we get to sit in America! I only lasted about 2 hours into the service when I decided I had seen enough and was falling asleep standing up. During this time there was mostly the reciting of names of disciples and saints, lots of prayers and lots of bowing. As I was leaving the Bishop was calling for the bread and wine to be brought out for communion. The process to bless and prepare the wine and bread would take about an hour. At which time people could begin to take communion. The whole experience was fantastic and though I wish I had the strength to stay all night I am happy to have seen what I did. Thanks to my new-found friend Eugene I am sure to revisit the church soon and get a better idea of how Russian Orthodox followers practice their faith. Here are some fantastic photos of the Cathedral. I took the first two inside during the midnight mass but it was a little difficult to appropriately take photos. So I found some other ones on the internet. [gallery order=”DESC” link=”post” ids=”1492,1493,1494,1495,1491,1488,1490,1489,1497”] Here is a great video I found on YouTube of nice panoramic shots of the inside and outside of the cathedral. The inside is much different than what we expect in the west. "

    "body": "2013/01/05 - [gallery link=”file” ids=”1297,1299,1300,1302,1303”] Photo Credit: Kloop. kg (source) Bringing in 2013 in Kyrgyzstan was quite a spectacular series of events! Unlike in America, New Years Eve is a formal family affair. Imagine combining Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year all together: Santa Clause (Father Frost) and his grand daughter deliver presents to children on New Years Eve, every house has a New Years Tree decorated almost exactly as westerners would expect to find a Christmas tree and at midnight there are fireworks and champaign to bring it all to a close. All of this is celebrated with family; friends rarely get into the mix. Last year I was lucky enough to be invited to a friend’s home in Talas where we indulged in an endless table of food but an early night to bed. The village was a bit lacking in activity. This year I was unsuccessful in getting an invitation in Bishkek. I think most of my friends thought they were doing me a favor by NOT inviting me to sit with their families all night. Most of my friends would rather be out with their friends but are obliged to stay at home. So I did what I know how to do best: I threw my own party! But more on that in a moment… The day started off like a usual day (except no Russian lesson and no work) but then around lunch time I heard the sound of a marching band (unheard of around here) passing my window playing Jingle Bells! I look outside and see a parade of hundreds of Santas, clowns and city officials. Every year the mass of characters parades from the main square to city hall where the mayor dishes out presents to the parade participants. Then the parade turns around and returns to the main square where children (mostly orphans and top students) await and are delivered the presents. Very cool. The evening affair was a little crazy. Afraid of being alone or having a lame party (even worse!) I more or less made a blanket open invitation to the entire city to come to my house for a New Years Eve party. I made a lot of new friends this night! My apartment is very small: only a bedroom and kitchen, yet I had around 50 guests who represented 15 countries and even a DJ came with all of his equipment and made my kitchen a real club. The neighbors were kind enough to not complain until 5am. It was a great success and lots of fun. At midnight the fireworks abounded. I live only 2 blocks from the main square so going there to see the fireworks was easy. It was not quite the display we would expect in America but it was still nice. One major difference was that alongside the city-sponsored fireworks were many personal fireworks being set off. We met more interesting people at the square and brought them back to my house to keep the party going. The night was epic. Now 2013 is here and it’s time to think about the future. I have had some amazing years recently but what I have planned for 2013 might just top them all. On the list is a over-land journey from Kyrgyzstan to Portugal this summer, possibly going to graduate school in Europe next fall and setting the stage to make a long-awaited return to Brazil in 2014. I have no resolutions to declare as I sibscribe to the phillosophy of “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it!” And things so far are going just fine. Happy New Years to you and yours and may 2013 fulfill all of your greatest wishes! "

I also got in quite a few runs, 15 or so! There is a new upper-lift on the right side of the mountain and this was really the best skiing. It is challenging and fast. But the best part is the lift has literally no wait because most people are afraid to go to this summit (my theory). We went to a resort not far from Bishkek called Зил (Zil) which is my favorite place to ski. They say the best skiing in Kyrgyzstan is in Karakol but for me it is not worth the 6-8 hour drive to Karakol for skiing that is probably only marginally better than the skiing just near Bishkek.

One of many such events he hosts in his home to share American culture and Louisiana cuisine. ” %} Greetings Tiger Nation, As beautiful summer days become a distant memory from this dark and cold Kyrgyzstani winter, I wrap myself in the warm knowledge that though my time here is quickly coming to a close, I have indeed made a difference. My accomplishments here have been diverse: development of rural community radio stations throughout the country, summer camps developing students’ decision-making skills regarding healthy lifestyle choices, English clubs and now the development of the first original news internet radio broadcast from Central Asia. What else could I hope to accomplish in my last six months? Lots! Though I have been working on the business and sustainability model of the internet radio broadcast at http://kloop. kg/online-radio/, we still have to begin the actual broadcast. This should happen sometime in January. Once we begin with our broadcast, we will have a lot of further development to do: writing new programs, scheduling in-studio programs and developing the syndication pipeline of programs originating from the rural regions of Kyrgyzstan. In addition to the development work I am doing, there are many important cross-cultural activities I participate in. My favorite activity has been hosting dinner parties at my apartment so that I can share Louisiana-style food with my Kyrgyz friends. Usually this means red beans and rice because the ingredients are available here and it is cheap and easy to cook for large groups. Spicy food is not so common in Kjyrgyzstan so I go easy on the spices but I haven’t had anyone complain yet. As would be expected, the food has convinced a few people that Louisiana is a place they need to visit one day. Mission accomplished! I have 6-months of service remaining in the Peace Corps and it seems that my options for continuing development work in the region are quite good. Which is exactly what I want to do. I am excited about these future opportunities but my focus now is to finish strong and to not miss any steps in the homestretch. I also have some more travel to do in the area. I still need to visit some regions of Kyrgyzstan and hopefully I can also make a visit to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. This is a beautiful part of the world and very far from home so I hope to really experience as much of it as possible in my final months. The overwhelming support from Tiger Nation has been such a help to my making it through this wonderful but challenging time. The numerous messages and packages I have received from many of you have shown me how truly blessed I am to be a part of such a great group of people! A million thanks for all of that and special thanks to Erica Leigh Martin, Aeslya Fuqua, Alia Rezek and Jenny &amp; Jason Marze (among others!) for the multitude of mail they have sent me!

And what makes it even better is that an entire day’s cost (transport, food, ski rental and lift pass) costs less than $30. 00! My friend, Artiom, has his own tourism company called Travel In KG. He works non-stop in the summer months but in winter he takes his time to relax. However, he still has his van and he is still happy to drive folks around who need to get somewhere. So Artiom gives us a great price for driving us and joins us skiing. It is a great win-win situation! Plus, he is awesome and super fun to hang out with. So it really doesn’t get much better. You can see more fun Artiom and I are having in my post, Biking to Panorama. On today’s ski trip I was unfortunately too excited to actually take any photos of skiing, even though I did have my camera with me all day. Instead, here are some photos of putting on the snow chains half way up the mountain.

Greetings Tiger Nation, Hot weather, sports, seemingly endless food, group activities and an element of learning by fun. Yes, it has all the symptoms of summer camp season and even half a world away few things feel different other than the language and towering mountains engulfing a summer of inspirational camps and fun. A Peace Corps Volunteer’s role often turns into that of a camp director in summer time. This summer I had many rewarding service opportunities conducting camps and special trainings for kids from all around Kyrgyzstan. Themes have ranged from HIV/AIDS education, to making appropriate decisions in healthy relationships, to implementing social media strategies in rural areas serviced by community radio. The experience that most touched me, however, was a bit of a special situation. Peace Corps Volunteers are not allowed to travel to the southern regions of Kyrgyzstan so a camp from the Jalalabad region brought their kids to me in the north. The camp was a seven-day English camp for 15 students and after the seven days participants traveled to Bishkek where we then made a two-day training in basic computer skills. Some of these students had never even touched a computer before but upon completion of the camp all participants demonstrated skills in basic Microsoft Word and Excel, used email to send, receive and save files and messages, explored a variety of information on the internet searching with Google and registered with Twitter via SMS. A main goal of the camp was to inspire these students to think about their future and to see what possibilities exist outside of their village. Meerim, the university student who organized the camp, is from the same village as the camp participants but found scholarships to study in America, is a recent university graduate and has many opportunities in life. She wanted to use her own example, and example of others, to inspire these students to realize that they can have dreams and follow them. Brining them to Bishkek to work with me was a large part of showing them things outside of their own environment. Hands down this was extraordinarily effective at inspiring the students and it was a great inspiration to me as well. At the end of summer I changed my worksite to the capital city where I will develop syndication agreements between the community radio stations throughout Kyrgyzstan and the Kloop Media Foundation (www. kloop. kg) who will broadcast content from the rural areas onto the internet. I conceptualized this project and will be working with local and national media as well as several multi-national organizations to develop a sustainable plan. My last ten months of service promise to be full of challenges and rewards! I continue to love my life and have great pride in my service to the Kyrgyz people. I hope that you find a way to serve your own community and find your own inspiration to better your world. As always, you may follow my adventure at https://www. judsonlmoore. com and @JudsonLMoore.

(Please update your records with my new address available on this PDF Mailing Label). Previously, while working in Talas, I was working at RadioMost 100. 5 FM, the premier community radio station of Kyrgyzstan, where I was assisting them to develop new radio stations across all regions of the country. Now I have moved to Bishkek to work with the Kloop Media Foundation to develop the first ever internet radio broadcast originating from Kyrgyzstan. This station’s format will be similar to NPR or the BBC in that it will be mostly news but will also feature special stories originating from corespondents, or in our case the programs will largely originate from the community radio stations with which I have worked for the past year. The New Project: KyrgyzMedia. com: This project aims to expand the reach of the small radio stations in the rural areas of the country and allow for the whole world to tune in 24/7 and listen to radio journalists reporting from all regions of the country. Kloop currently produces a daily 30-minute news program in 3 languages (Russian,  Kyrgyz and Uzbek) which can be heard at http://radio. kloop. kg. Analytics of the Kloop website suggest that our main audience are Kyrgyz immigrant workers living abroad, primarily in Russia. By providing streaming radio, these Kyrgyz people living abroad will have a chance to hear not only the national and headline news of Kyrgyzstan, but hear what is happening in their home communities. The internet broadcast is scheduled to begin in January 2013. I will keep you updated on our progress. My Ask Of You: In the meantime, please consider sending me a care package (I’m out of peanut butter!) and check out these photos of my new city: The White House is the presidential work place of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is about 1 block from my apartment. Ala Too Color Guard The National Philharmonic was the site of my swearing-in ceremony to the Peace Corps and is about 2 blocks from my apartment. Lenin stands strong facing the parliament building of the Kyrgyz Republic. His back is to the National History Museum, which used to be the Lenin Museum. "

We went in two cars but one broke down so we had to pile, very unsafely, into the other. The mountains were beautiful and the food was amazing. Almanbet didn’t bother to tell anyone it was his birthday but one of the girls with us revealed the secrete to us at the end of the day. It’s a pretty standup guy who just wants to enjoy time with his old friends and new on his birthday and not even bring attention to the fact. Almanbet, Happy Birthday! "

This is a very large lake which dominates the map of Kyrgyzstan in the east. It is 118x37 miles in size and it’s deepest point is nearly 2,000 feet (668m)! It is the second largest mountain lake in the world behind Lake Titicaca in South America.  There is hardly anything alive in the lake due to over fishing during Soviet times. We were diving to a depth of 10m around a dead coral reef and the largest sign of life I saw was a shrimp-like crustacean about the length of my thumbnail.

    "body": "2012/07/13 - If there is a reason why I joined the Peace Corps it was the experience of the last few days. I conducted an ICT training for students from the southern oblast of Jalalabad where I am not allowed to travel due to Peace Corps regulations. Since I could not go to them, they came to me! Many of these students had never touched a computer before and their only interaction with the internet was what they could access through their cell phones and using text-based messaging service. While covering the basics of the internet, search, social media, research and MC Office, these students all picked up the taught basic skills right away. They were truly incredible. We also organized a tour for them of the local Sierra Coffee bean roasting facility and a number of universities so they could see for their own eyes what entrepreneurial and educational opportunities existed in Kyrgyzstan. Camp organizer,  Meerim Mamyrbekova, wrote a fantastic final report so rather than try to redo what she has so well done herself, I have just given you some photos and included the text of the final report below. [gallery link=”file” order=”DESC”] Project description Between July 1 and 12, 2012 the Multidisciplinary Summer Camp with the slogan of “Stay hungry. Stay foolish” (Steeve Jobs) was held for village kids, who lack motivation, information, leadership skills, English and Computer knowledge. Realization of English and Leadership trainings for the students had happened in the territory of Kyzyl Tuu school in Aksy region, Jalalabad oblast. Project was accomplished with the participation of 15 Kyzyl Tuu high school students, 1 UGRAD alumna, a 5th year student-volunteer and a Peace Corps volunteer. 2-day IT training was held in Bishkek due to unexpected changes, where American Corner in Karakol, Issyk Kul refused to provide camp participants with IT class since U. S. Embassy came up to conduct their own trainings there, although we had their support letter promising to give us a computer-equipped classroom. In addition, a project collaborator Marziya Davlyatova was not able to participate due to her unexpected family issues. Multidisciplinary summer camp’s primary goal was to break the barrier that prevented many village kids from competing with more privileged city kids; many of current village students care more about working in the fields rather than studying. They stopped believing in the “fairy tale” that they could get full scholarship at the university, study abroad, be successful leaders, participate in different trainings, activities and use Internet for academic purpose. For instance, there is not a single student from Kyzyl Tuu high school who has won a school competition on the regional level, leave alone national one; FLEX, UGRAD fellowship and university full scholarships. The summer camp was aimed to motivate school kids and assist them in choosing their career path and right universities, which for sure would cause in bringing up future promising figures and leaders of the Kyrgyz Republic. The information and advertisements concerning the universities were limited in that region, which could reduce ambitiousness of the school kids. By offering such opportunity, the students may come up with variety range of ideas, choices and goals. My big contribution to the implementation of the project was realization of multidisciplinary summer camp which seemed impossible in the beginning not only for Kyzyl Tuu community, but also for my friends. While having 10-day summer camp I found myself being a manager, trainer and a tour guide. My responsibilities were bigger than other trainers’ since I was a project manager and I had to make sure that everything was going according to our plan and mainly to make primary goals of the project be accomplished. 10-day Multidisciplinary Summer Camp contained three trainings: English, Leadership and IT. 15 school children took part in it, who earlier were selected through essay competition. Each applicant applied by writing 2 essays, one in Kyrgyz “The future of my country” and the second in English “I am a leader of my community”. Panel included Duishon Tursunbaev, a school principal, Judson Moore, Peace Corps Volunteer, Marziya Davlyatova, Tajikistan UGRAD alumna and Meerim Mamyrbekova, Kyrgyzstan UGRAD alumna. Summer camp lasted from July 1 till July 11, 2012. Trainers went to Kyzyl Tuu village school, Aksy region, Jalalabad oblast to conduct 7-day English and Leadership trainings. 2-day IT training was held in Bishkek and 1-day tours to Bishkek universities were realized in Bishkek as well. We will try to give a summary of each training and describe some interesting activities. English Training Trainer Aigul Samudinova, a 5th year student of International Ataturk-Alatoo University (IAAU), Simultaneous Translation Department. Aigul has experiences in teaching kids at language course center in Bishkek. Her method included Communicative, Direct, Suggestopedia, Translation methods of teaching. Starting from the first day trainer Aigul encouraged students to speak English although they had big language gap. The trainer used the book called Embassy English Coursebook: Top Notch 2A Workbookand Take-Home Super CD-ROM by Joan Saslow and Allen Ascher. Each Aigul’s class started with warming up activities to wake up kids and be involved in the class. They were “Name Association”, “Sing a song”, “Simon says”, “Chef” and “Poem River”. For instance, “Simon says” is an activity which can be used to train kids to learn words related to movement and body; “Chef” is a very good activity, where students in a team set a table and cook dish with their imaginations using ingredients and verbs. Trainees started English class from To be, English nouns and verbs, Past, Present and Future Tenses. Explanation of grammar was always accompanied by different exercises. Aigul was not really stuck to a book; instead she shared her own prepared handouts and exercises. Each class was planned beforehand and therefore, each activity was logically related to each other. It was student-centered class, where every other time pair work and group work helped much to involve kids, who were a bit shy from the rest. Kids’ preparedness showed how they were interested in class and how they waited the next day to learn something new. Aigul did not load students with heavy home assignments, but only asked to work on exercises from work book. However, kids themselves eagerly absorbed each new information. Her easy-going character and openness did not cause any trouble to deal with village kids. Her personal story and creativity motivated each student to be more creative and start their own academic journey. Students realized how learning could be fun if they were offered various interesting activities. Trainers did their best to reach each student by asking and approaching individually to check if they were catching up. Leadership Training Trainer Meerim Mamyrbekova, a graduate of IAAU and UGRAD alumna For seven days after English class in the morning, Meerim held leadership training afternoons. Training started with explanation of a leader and the next exercise that followed was defining a leader with the help of adjectives for students associated a leader only with a politician. Leadership course included topics as “Who is a leader?”, “Leadership styles: authoritative, persuasive and delegative”, “Focus: task-focused, people-focused and dual-focused leaders”,  “Need for better listening”, “7 fallacies about listening”,  and “types of listening. ” Each class gave an opportunity for kids to have the floor to speak; firstly, to fight against their fear and secondly, always to have their own opinion since according to Soviet style classroom, students were never asked about their feelings. The book on Leadership “Listening Effectively” by John Kline was a center of attention in this class. Meerim, has personally taken J. Kline’s class in the US on Leadership. During the lesson Meerim organized different activities which helped to strengthen students’ ability to become a leader of their community. Activities included “Choosing a leader” (3 teams drew their 3 leaders and defined their leadership styles) and “presenting leaders’ pictures” (students guessed names of leaders).  In addition, special attention was paid to Steve Jobs for trainers borrowed his words to make a slogan of the camp, “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish”. The trainer covered S. Job’s biography, creations and his Apple. Students listened to his commencement speech at Stanford University with so much enthusiasm, when Meerim translated it into Kyrgyz. Obviously, speaking is nothing without writing, so one day students learned how to write an essay following English standards. On the very last day of the training Meerim shared her own adventures and stories of being a leader in different situations: her being a finalist in the English language contest on the national level, being ranked the second among entire university based on her high GPA, becoming UGRAD finalist, travelling alone in New York, combining school and work, and making a lot of friends, inspired kids more than other stories. They asked tons of questions where Meerim answered with so much joy. IT training Trainer Judson Moore, a Peace Corps Volunteer, Web developer IT training which was planned to be held in Karakol, Issyk Kul at American Corner was conducted in Bishkek at National IT Center. Karakol’s American Corner refused on the last day to host this summer camp due to the US Embassy’s upcoming training. However, we did not lose our hope and were lucky to find a real IT class in Bishkek. We rented a class with 15 computers; it had internet WiFi, AC in that hot summer, a projector and a nice board.  Each student had a chance to use one computer. Judson Moore, IT trainer charmed students with his simple method of explaining the topics. Meerim served as a translator when kids had difficulties in understanding some computer terms. Judson taught kids step by step for typing, Microsoft Word, Excel, opening email in www. mail. ru, Youtube, Google, Wikipedia, Skype, Facebook and Twitter. Within 2 days camp participants were able not only to type, but also how to surf on the internet; kids voted unanimously to open accounts on Twitter. Moreover, Judson explained how social networks could be useful in education. He spoke about the advantages of Facebook and Twitter over Mail Agent, which is a social network for CIS. Meerim’s friends Jyrgal Ormonov, Raimaly Narjigitov and Nurgazy Zhusubaliev assisted Judson in order to reach every student and help if they had difficulties. Jyrgal Ormonov, an active tweeple, shared advantages of using Twitter. Moreover, a skype talk with Murat Zhigitekov, a graduate of Mississippi College who currently lives in Texas diversified our training. For 15 minutes Murat spoke about his way of becoming a leader, how is to study in the US and shared a couple of inspirational moral and personal stories. Even a school principal, Duishon Tursunbaev enjoyed typing and surfing on the internet. During lunch we ordered different types of pizzas; students were exposed to try famous American food which seemed so delicious to them. Activities As we mentioned previously very different activities, role playing games and contests colored our summer camp. The most memorable games were “Who is the smartest?”, “Talant show”  and Jengo. In the first contest students had to answer various educational questions, that touched almost every field. After each round, students voted to make one player to be out of the game.  Rakhat, a winner was given a purse as a prize. During Talant show every participant showed their talents, some of them danced, read riddles, played the komuz, made paper flowers, drew and made a salad. The winner Asel Akmatalieva, who showed her ability of being a host of TV show, received a monolingual English dictionary that Meerim brought from the US. Jengo is an American game with wood sticks cheered kids very much. Also, we had an amazing presentation of Bred, who is the founder of the coffee company Sierra, about how he launched Bishkek Coffee Roasters, which definitely touched everybody.   To be honest, almost none of us had seen how coffee that we buy was prepared. Another fun was at Bishkek’s Panvilov Park, where kids were taken after IT training. University tours On July 11th our group visited many state and private universities of Bishkek. Almost each university gave a guide to conduct a campus tour and tell what faculties and departments they had. Each camp participant was given brochures about the universities. Results and Impact Overall, summer camp influenced students from the positive side. Kids overcame their fear and after camp we could notice their readiness to compete with city students. Many of them learned beneficial information about universities and exchange programs. Another, people to impact on kids were Meerim’s international friends who believed in changes and supported the camp living in other parts of the world. For instance, Irina Tsumareva, UGRAD fellow from Belarus and Meerim’s best friend, sent a special letter addressed for kids to inspire them to dream big and always try to accomplish their goals. Pluses and Minuses of the camp Pluses were that in short days we could cover a lot of effective information. We taught how to communicate in English, practiced it with a native speaker, learned leadership qualities and basic computer skills. Minus was to hear refusal from American Corner on the very last day. It was a good lesson for the project manager to learn for the next. It was hard for trainers to inform kids this bad news who had already imagined themselves seeing a great lake of Kyrgyzstan. In addition, trainers could not arrange something before their arrival to Bishkek since it was weekend. Monday morning for the first day of IT training Meerim ran back and forth and finally could overcome this obstacle by finding an amazing IT center and start the training on time with the help of Judson Moore. However, it showed our flexibility and ability to deal with spontaneous changes. We’re on TV During IT training a correspondent Ali Toktakunov from Azattyk, Liberty Radio came to interview us for their upcoming TV show about young leaders. After a week we were shown on TV on Kyrgyz Channel One in the video reportage part. Also, Judson Moore, our IT trainer is writing an article about this summer camp for the journal of Louisiana State University, which hopefully will be published in fall. Here is the link for video from Azattyk http://www. azattyk. kg/media/video/24647888. html; Changes Upon starting summer camp project it began to bring changes to Kyzyl Tuu school. A school teacher who was so involved with our project has shown his own positive work abilities that later was noticed by a mayor and a head of regional schools and ended up with an appointment of Duishon Tursunbaev as a new principal of Kyzyl Tuu school. We could see changes in the eyes of the students as well. Now they see a lot of opportunities around them and try to better their community. The project brought changes to me as well. I hope my gained managerial skills will help me much in my work. During my UGRAD years in the US I learned to dream big and to be able to realize it no matter I see obstacles in my way.  My current ability encouraged me to be the first person to hold a summer camp in entire Kyzyl Tuu village. Camp participants came up with an idea to continue this summer camp after ASG completion by opening a club for young leaders at school. They unanimously voted to continue this great project by educating and sharing their gained knowledge and experiences with other school children. I agreed to provide them with books, training materials, brochures and even attend some of their trainings. Also, I will do my best to bring international guests there for them to exchange information. Special thanks We greatly thank IREX for supporting our project by making our dreams come true. Thanks to our friends-contributors Lisl Trowbridge, who sent free English books for camp participants from the US, Nurseit Maksatbekov, contributed money voluntarily, Mr. Wayne Locklar, Troy University Professor, sent American crayons to the trainees. Special thanks to Meerim’s Kyrgyz and international friends for believing in changes and supporting this project from the very beginning. "

Over the last year I have engaged in many activities, learned a lot about myself and worked hard to help others learn skills useful to their own endeavors. Among my activities have been: coat and blanket distributions, English clubs, computer and internet trainings, community beautification projects, grant writing seminars, event management trainings and numerous cross-cultural exchanges. As rewarding as all this has been, I am now gearing up for what will likely be the most impact full activity I will carry out: summer camp. In July I will be directing a summer camp for 28 high-schoolers in the beautiful Besh Tash National Park in the scenic mountains near my home in Talas. The theme of this camp will be HIV / AIDS education and the development of life skills related to relationships and making healthy decisions. Kyrgyzstan is developing in areas of health education and struggles with the practice of bride-kidnapping. By bringing young boys and girls together at this camp we will help them make healthy life choices and encourage them to engage in a mixed-gender dialogue; something which can be difficult for them to do in the rural areas of this region. The format of this camp has proven to be a successful way for Peace Corps Volunteers to make a great impact in Kyrgyzstan for many years. Students from the region look forward to the opportunity to be selected for this camp and have high expectations of it’s outcomes. Meeting this expectation will take all the skills and knowledge I have obtained over the years and this challenge thrills me. I have had a wonderful and meaningful first half of my Peace Corps service and I am excited to finish strong in the second half. While I continue to conduct trainings in the aforementioned areas, I find that just now I am beginning to grasp both the real needs and desires of the Kyrgyz Republic. I expect that the next year will be one to remember!

Katrina, Rita, Gustav… I know what I am talking about!) The car was late picking us up, the ski rental shop was closed, finally found another one, then drove to the resort, our car couldn’t make it up the mountain so about a mile short of the skibase we strapped on our ski boots and hiked up while lugging our skis. Reaching the skibase totally exhausted and freezing I went into the cafe and ordered lagman and chai which cost about 500com (5 times what you would expect to pay anywhere else). Then hit the slopes to find them icy and oh yea, my three friends I was with, turns out they had never skied before so they made one run down the icy and pretty advanced slope and called it quits. While on the slope I got a call saying our evening accommodations were backing out and so when we went to the city at night we were homeless. Luckily our driver invited myself and fellow PCV Preston Clark to his house to stay the night. Glad this day is over. Goodnight! "

    "body": "2012/03/17 - Greetings Tiger Nation, As the New Year gets it’s start in this winter wonderland of Central Asia, I find myself drowning in opportunity for service in 2012. Starting off on the right foot in a partnership with United States Air Force soldiers from the Manas Transit Center in Bishkek (the gateway for American soldiers entering and leaving Afghanistan), I worked to distribute 1500 coats and blankets to needy children in western Kyrgyzstan.  “Operation Warm &amp; Dry” was a military humanitarian mission that partnered with Peace Corps Volunteers and PCV-counterparts to bring warmth to those who most need it.  It was an honor to work with US servicemen but most importantly the project made a great impact. With only 18 more months of Peace Corps service left, I am starting to feel the time crunch in front of me.  Searching for ways to make an impact before I leave, I have started to turn my goals from more than the development of one community radio station, but instead the development of all independent and community media throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. I participate in national conferences of community media outlets on a regular basis in the capital city and a reoccurring issue is the need for a virtual information exchange where discussions can continue beyond the conference, media can be uploaded/downloaded, journalists can connect with each other and stories can be shared with the world. The major problem is that many of these journalists have poor access to internet and lack the facility to create websites.  They do however have great technical ability, are good writers and have at least some level of internet access. So I came up with a solution.  I am building a network of websites that will serve to unify Kyrgyz Independent and community media under one internet brand.  This site will be part social network, part web hosting solution and 100% Kyrgyz media.  With the ability to share information with each other, file-sharing, host their own websites and have the world access their work, I believe that this can be a highly impactful resource for bringing more of Kyrgyzstan to the world. You may visit http://KyrgyzMedia. com to see the development of this site. I wish you and yours a prosperous 2012 and encourage you to work for the betterment of the community in which you live!  As always, you may follow my adventure at https://www. judsonlmoore. com. __ Source: LSU Alumni Magazine, Spring 2012 Edition, p. 78 http://issuu. com/lsualumni/docs/spring2012_lsuaamag "

    "body": "2011/12/04 - Being as far away from America as I am did not put even the slightest dent in my celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday last week. Thanks to the US Embassy in Bishkek and the Peace Corps staff we had 3 x 20lbs Butterball turkeys and all the dishes you would expect to see at any American celebration of thanks. The PC Medical Officer (who plays excellent blues guitar) and I provided the entertainment. He played blues/jazz guitar while I accompanied on drums and occasionally I also played guitar. This was my first public guitar performance and I feel pretty good about it. I even led a few sing-alongs of American Pie and Stand By Me. While in Bishkek for the week I visited a rehearsal studio for a few hours and got some time in on drums after a year of no practice. I believe this may be the only existing video of me playing drums and unfortunately the memory card ran out of space after just 3 minutes. But for your enjoyment: With the new year just around the corner Kyrgyzstan has made Central Asian history by peacefully and fairly electing a new president. The elections at the end of October resulted in a landslide victory for former prime minster Almazbek Atambaev. President Atambaev took office on December 1st and so far everything is smooth-sailing. All of the local people I know seem to think he is the right person for the job. Next week I will be going to Bishkek again to ski for a few days and to attend a training on grant writing. The project I will be developing is aimed at using iPads for the creation and broadcast of radio and written news stories from the rural villages of western Kyrgyzstan. My office, Radiomost, has an extensive network of community journalists throughout the region but sometimes their involvement can be restricted by logistical obstructions like road conditions, travel time, power outages and social/family obligations. With iPads, journalists can create, edit and email programs with great efficiency and low cost. I feel strongly about the merit of this project and believe that when successful, it will serve as a blueprint for using mobile devices for information creation throughout the developing world. Snow here is starting to get pretty thick. Though I have been warned that I haven’t really seen anything yet. This Louisiana boy doesn’t do cold or snow, so it will be an interesting next few months to see how I adapt. I have a beautiful view of snow-capped mountains out my bedroom window which is nice to look at, just not to go out in! My Russian language is progressing at an accelerating rate. I am excited for the day when I can actually hold basic conversations. Right now I am understanding a lot of what people are saying, I just don’t know how to respond to it. The grammar of Russian is very intense. Every word of a sentence is conjugated based on gender, number and who the statement is directed toward. The New Year is quickly approaching and though I won’t be attending any Manhattan roof-top parties this year, my family tells me they have an annual celebration of epic proportions. I you a safe and happy holiday season. Keep in touch! (oh and GEAUX TIGERS! SEC Champs 2011!!!) "

    "title": "Program Travel Report Nov 13-27, 2011",
    "body": "2011/12/02 - Sunday Nov 13 - Monday Nov 14: These were travel days to the HIV Training in Cholpon Ata. The first day was travel by taxi from Talas to Bishkek.   The second day was travel by PC-supplied charter bus from PC Office - Cholpon Ata.   One thing to note was that for Talas volunteers it was impossible to travel to Bishkek on the same day as traveling to Cholpon Ata due to the winter road conditions being too unstable to guarantee our arrival on time. On the PC Charter Bus I took advantage of my Russian tutor being present.   We sat together and did a 3-hour lesson consisting of vocabulary drills and verb conjugations. Tuesday Nov 15 - Thursday Nov 18: These are the HIV Training dates.   The information about HIV/AIDS and prevention were mostly things that I had already been familiar with.   What was brilliant about this training as a TOT is that we were not just told information and by nature of receiving that information expected to know what to do with it.   Rather, the trainers consisted of personal stories from the trainers (all PCVs) about how they would train different type/ages of people in different environments.   Also demonstrated how there are different activities that are appropriate for different topics and different audiences. It should be noted that I recognize this as the highest-quality training I have received in PC and the curious part of this observation is that there was no local or PC-staff involvement in the daily trainings.   I have said since the beginning how important I thought it was to hear directly from PCVs telling us their story, experiences and lessons learned that locals and staff can not possibly convey to us.   This aspect was strong in this training and the result, I feel, was superb.  I also continued to take advantage of the presence of my Russian tutor during this week and had lessons with her every night after the trainings.   I also feel quite proud that for this whole training I did not interact with a single volunteer outside of the sessions.   I ate with local people and in the evenings I only spent time with local people.   It was a breath of fresh air. Friday Nov 19 - Tuesday Nov 23: On Friday I went to Karakol in the far east of Kyrgyzstan to visit fellow PCVs.   Within 2 hours of being in town I observed a training of teachers led by Catie Scott.  After this I was asked to speak at the Leadership Organization.   Leadership is a group of 20 (or so) 14-20 year old students that are interested in being community leaders and volunteering their time.   I was asked to speak about the Peace Corps and my story of volunteerism.   I drew a timeline of my volunteering life, starting in community theater when I was 14 and coming all the way up to my Peace Corps service.   I described how each experience led to the next opportunity, job opportunities, education, travel and how I expect all of this will impact my future opportunities. These were the smartest and most engaged group of students I have either met or even heard of in Kyrgyzstan.   From my understanding (but limited interactions with) students in Talas it seems like students in Kyrgyzstan are “lost causes. ”  Karakol proved this was not the case. On Saturday and Sunday I spent my time exploring the city and meeting PCVs in Karakol.   I also did 2 hours of language tutoring with the Russian tutor of Bob Scott. On Monday I met with Mark Iozzi to learn about micro finance and business finance in Kyrgyzstan.   This was very informative and what I learned is that 9 out of 10 times micro-credit is a horrible idea (with the exceptions usually being within agricultural projects).   He also gave some presentations and information regarding the topic and spent 1. 5 hours going through it all in a quick training. Tuesday Nov 23 - Nov 28: On Tuesday I departed early from Karakol and went to Bishkek.   When I came to Bishkek I attended the meeting for the Rotary Club of Bishkek.   The guest speaker was the President of Andash Gold and Copper Mine in Talas Oblast.   I also met 3 Rotary Youth Exchange Students from the USA that are now studying in Bishkek. On Wednesday I met briefly with Seth regarding the ongoing (and unrealized) idea of a radio drama.   At this meeting he mentioned having recently seen the movie, “Bishkek I Love You,” and that he had personally met the director of the film. After the meeting with Seth I had a lunch meeting with the international advisor for Radiomost, Bettina Ruigies.   At this meeting she described for me what the seminar later in the week would be about (called Development of Community Media in Kyrgyzstan).   She informed me this was a technical training about how to conduct interviews and how to create programs from raw audio. Bettina had the idea that on Friday night we would go see a movie as a group and then take interviews from other moviegoers about their impressions of the film.   She suggested seeing Twilight or something in 3D.   I countered by stating I had just heard there is a really great local film and if we saw this film I might be able to get the director to meet us and take part in the interviews. Long story short, we did see Bishkek I Love You and the director, producer and one actress joined us for dinner after the film and did interviews for about one hour.   It was a great success. The rest of the seminar was very interesting and educational.   All participants received brand new Dell Laptops, software, studio headphones and professional recording devices. We also visited the National History Museum and National Art Gallery to interact with the public and to take interviews for radio programs. At the end of the seminar, among other outcomes, it was decided that I would redesign the RadioMost website.   This is a project I have been pushing for since this summer, but just now got the green light for. Thursday evening I also visited with the Rotaract Club of Bishkek (hosted at AUCA).   The meeting was canceled due to Thanksgiving but I still met the club officers for dinner. Sunday Nov 28, 2011: I returned to Talas. "

    "body": "2011/11/27 - Happy Thanksgiving! Things here were very eventful on Thursday but not a a holiday. However,this week has been quite amazing. On Tuesday I returned to Bishkek fromKarakol (ski town in the far east of Kyrgyzstan) and went to Rotary for the1st time where I met (among others) some exchange students from the USA,who I then joined for Mexican food (1st time!) the next day for lunch. After the meeting I went to a cafe and sat in with a band for a while. Iknocked their socks off! Apparently, though Kyrgyzstan has no shortage oftalented musicians, there are not many drummers, and even as out ofpractice as I am, I was among the best they had ever heard. As a result, Iwas invited to a studio on Thursday and then to play a 2-hour gig onFriday. Unfortunately I could not make the Friday gig due to thisconference I am at now. But I will be back here for a week in December andI will almost certainly be able to play a gig then. This current conference is part of the UNESCO series I have been attendingevery 6 weeks for the lasst few months, but this one is the mostinteresting. It is a technical training. . all the local participants gotnew Dell laptops, recording devices, headphone. . the works. The trainingsfocus on how to conduct interviews. For fun we decided to see a movie lastnight and then interview other movie-goers. Seth (PC Country Director)told me of a local film, “Bishkek I love You” which he thought was quitegood and he knew the director. So I suggested we go to that movie. I wasable to contact the director and he, the producer and 1 actress joined usfor dinner after the film and took interviews. I think I have some newfriends there! (The director is Kyrgyz but is also a graduate of WestPoint… who knew you could do that?!) On Saturday we went to the national art gallery but it was closed so wewent to the national history museum instead. I will get photos up of thaton Facebook soon. After the museum I departed from the conference for therest of the day to celebrate Thanksgiving with the PC staff and Bishkekvolunteers. We had 3 20lbs Butterball turkeys curtsey the Embassy. At thelunch I gave my first public guitar performance and also accompanied the PCdoctor on guitar and drums. We did sing-alongs to American Pie and StandBy Me. It was a great success. The conference ends today and I should be going back to site after beingaway for 2 weeks. I am very ready to be home but the bad weather in themountains will probably force us to go through Kazakhstan which is a nicedrive but takes twice as long. Since we wont leave until after 3pm todayis likely to be quite exhausting! "

    "body": "2011/09/02 - Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the Kyrgyz Republic’s independence from the USSR. To mark the occasion there was a parade downtown in front of the White House (The State of Talas’s government building) in the morning followed by widely-held house parties, demonstrations of the national horse games and fireworks in the evening. The horse games were by far the most interesting thing I have seen in country. Essentially it is a game of Polo but instead of sticks, players used their hands, and instead of a ball, the object of attention is a headless sheep carcass. The manner in which the game is performed resembles more closely demolition derby than any other sport Westerners might be familiar with. I caught about the last hour of the game which would be longer than my attention span could handle most sporting events, but this was different. This was really a sight to see! In just this hour only 4 points were made (a snails-pace faster than soccer) but in hockey-style, 2 players got taken off the field by an ambulance after getting trampled by horses. Like in most sports, this seemed to be the favorite part of the game by the spectators. Here are some photos: The start of the parade in front of the Talas Oblast White House Youth carrying a giant flag of Kyrgyzstan Me at the horse games A rider got knocked off his horse trying to reach for the sheep (at his feet) which fell short of the goal (the mound encircled by tires) A successful grab of the sheep in full gallup The grand stands of the horse stadium More of me at the games (can you ever get enough?!) Today, September 1st, is the annual “First Bell” (first day of school) and so now life is going to change considerably for me, even though I have nothing to do with schools. For the summer all of the teacher PCVs have been on vacation. Sure they have participated in some camps and maybe a few clubs, but many have mostly been available to hang out with at any moment that they weren’t off traveling the country. I also live with 4 school-aged kids that won’t be hanging around the house all day, and when they are I imagine they will have homework. Also I walk by a university on my way to work. It has been an empty building most days but now it will be full of life with smart young people. All in all I am excited for school to be in session. I don’t yet know all of what that means to me, but I will soon enough. We are not having extreme weather here by any measure but it is extreme enough for me. I try not to whine too much about it. After all, I was raised in ice storms and cold weather really should be something I can adapt too. Lord knows I have the right cold weather gear. Unfortunately, it is September 1st and I am wearing some of that cold weather gear already. It’s not the weather of the day that frightens me, it’s the idea that it is this early and I am already freezing. I am wearing my thick wool socks, thick sweatpants, my Under Armor cold weather layer top and a jacket right now. And I am sitting in my house away from the elements. It’s going to be rough. But there is (obviously) no way that I am coming home early on account of the weather. If it is so unbearable then maybe there is a warmer part of the country or a consideration to move into the center of town near my work so I am not walking so far in the cold every day. Either way, I will get through it. Work has slowed down, but that is ok. I have been really hitting the books on the Russian and though I am a long way from being where I want to be, I am making major strides in the right direction. Of course I am still going to practice on my Kyrgyz, but I have 2 years to do it all in and the Russian is just the priority. It is the universal language here, it is the language of the media, politics and business, and above all I see in the volunteers that have been here longer than me that tried Kyrgyz and just gave up on it because the knowledge of Kyrgyz was not helping them here (or in future endeavors). They have either given up on the advancement of any local language or are trying to study Russian. Certainly I don’t intend to allow myself to get into that situation. I feel blessed every day to be here and to be in the Peace Corps. I am excited to be serving humanity and my country in this capacity. I am 6-months in and still trying to figure it all out and the future looks as bright as ever! "

Though I have only scratched the surface of my work’s potential and am still in the “honeymoon” phase, I feel like I have accomplished a lot. I will write more on the programs I have created later once they are funded. For now, allow me just to introduce you to my office. The MediaMost Foundation is a non-governmental organization located in Talas City in the western part of the Kyrgyz Republic. The mission of MediaMost is to bring about social reform and development by bridging the information gap and thus helping people in Talas prosper by giving them access to information. MediaMost’s primary operation is RadioMost FM 100. 5. This radio station is the pioneer community radio station of the Kyrgyz Republic. Broadcasting since July of 2007 with the assistance of UNESCO, the European Union Commission, GTZ, Deutsche Welle, and other partners, the current coveragearea in Talas Oblast reaches listeners in the districts of Karabuura, Talas, Bakay-Ata and the city of Talas. The audience of RadioMost is approximately 200,000 people. At the moment, RadioMost is the only community radio station in Talas Oblast.

News stories cover a range of topics including: basic human needs, gender equality, human rights, democracy and good governance, and peace and security. The music selection comes from all over the world but is primarily traditional Kyrgyz music or Russian and Western pop music. My goal is to introduce funk and blues while I am here. RadioMost’s assets include its own production studio, complete with professional equipment, which is utilized to create radio programs, audio clips, jingles and other audio products. There is also a resource library and multiple offices equipped with computers and internet. The team at RadioMost consists of professional journalists, technical engineers and volunteers who have considerable experience in radio, RadioMost personnel have been recognized for their work in various competitions at the national and international level.

    "body": "2011/06/24 - For many of you this post is going to sound like a broken record. But hey, it’s a big deal to me, so keep reading. :) My parent’s aside, I more or less give credit to Rotary International for me being who I am today. I won’t run down the whole history, but to understand what I want to say I need to go back (nearly) to the beginning. When I was in high school I had the opportunity to serve as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student in Germany for 1 year. The was my first time out of the country and certainly the longest that I was away from home. This opened my eyes to the world and and set the stage for my insistent need to constantly be on the move, discovering new places and knowing new people. After high school, I visited my Rotary exchange friends in Brazil where I backpacked around for 6 months. This opened my eyes wider but most importantly it gave me a glimpse into some of the great need that exists in the world. I dare say that Brazil is my favorite place I have ever been. The people have beautiful souls and the culture is phenomenal. As a developing nation, Brazil also has areas in need of great attention and help. The combination of these two international experiences and the values instilled in me by Rotary, led me to my path in life. I knew at 18 that I wanted to spend my life working in in the international theater in a capacity which brings help to those seeking it. So then the question was, “how do I make this life for myself?” It didn’t take long for me to learn about the Peace Corps and the doors PC service can open to the Foreign Service. My path was set. I went to college where I studied Political Science and was set on Peace Corps service immediately after college. However, for a combination of very good reasons, my service would be delayed a few years while I explored a very worthwhile career in the events and entertainment industry. I have a talent and passion for the events work I did and I am continuously finding those skills and experiences serving me very well in other facets of life. The problem I had with my past events career is that I was always too close to conversations that left passion behind and replaced it with a drive for profit. No doubt I am all about making money and hope to very successful in this manner throughout my life, but the drive for cash cannot outweigh the mission of the work for me. I needed something to believe in. I needed to get back on track with my life plan. I needed to get into the Peace Corps. And so it was from a dear friend, David Becker, whom I actually only knew for a short time while I was living in Los Angeles last summer, I was reminded what I needed to do and that there is no time like the present to do it. He had already been accepted into the Peace Corps and would spend the first year in graduate school as part of the Peace Corps Master’s Program before going abroad. Through our conversations, I was inspired to submit my application without delay. From their, the rest is history. David, by the way, is a member of the Rotary Family, and it is through this commonality that we met. The entire country of Kyrgyzstan has only one Rotary Club; in the capital of Bishkek. Last weekend, in my small town in isolated west Kyrgyzstan (7 hours from the capital) I went “guesting” at an acquaintance’s family’s house. This family has a daughter who is currently serving as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student in Germany. She is set to return home next month and I can’t wait to meet this new member of the Rotary Family. Rotary has given me much. Unique experiences, purpose, drive and so much more. But the most important thing is connectivity to a massive and wonderful network of people. As they say, “it’s the people that make the place,” and Rotary people are well-meaning humanitarians that have no borders to their influence and service. I am proud and honored to be a part of the Rotary Family. Being in the Peace Corps is a great way for me to fulfill the Rotary mission. Many years ago my dad gave me a coin that has the Rotary emblem and slogan, “Service Above Self,” on one side, and the 4-Way Test on the other. I carry this coin with me everyday and so in closing, I leave you with this Test to consider as you go about your affairs today: The 4-Way Test Of the things we think say or do:  Is it the TRUTH? Is it FAIR to all concerned? Will is build better GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS? Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?"

    "body": "2011/06/12 - Thus far in the Peace Corps, I have been elected or appointed into every available leadership roll. They are: Airport Captain:I was responsible for the movement of volunteers and information sharing of all logistics to all volunteers from JFK&gt;Istanbul&gt;Bishkek. There were 4 captains, for different stages of the journey. My responsibility seemed to be the most constantly active. . always having to count heads and mark off names every time we got onto or off of an airplane. I was always the last one onboard and the first one off. Trainee Action Committee:I was the representative of my language group during our 10-week training that had the “official” line of communication to the PC Staff in regards to things that we wanted to see changed, happen in general, or when the PC needed to distribute information to us, they would send it through me, and I would then share it with my group.  There were 8 language groups so the committee was 8 people. I represented 6 people in my group. Peer Support Network:This is a group of volunteers who have received some extra training and resources to be the “help line” for other PCVs. Volunteers needing advice, counseling, someone to talk to etc. . We are of course encouraged to just talk to anyone, but often times it is better to talk to an acquaintance than a close friend. This Network was setup as a means by which Volunteers can call on each other for this type of support. All calls are of course confidential and I am only mandated to share with Medical Staff in the event that I have reason to think someone will cause harm to themselves or others.  Of the 42 new Volunteers, 6 of us were selected for thisTalas Oblast Warden:Every Oblast (state) has a designated Volunteer who is a Warden. This person has many responsibilities but the primary function is to act as the liaison between volunteers in that region, and the PC Safety and Security Officer in the event of an emergency. If we are to be consolidated, evacuated, etc. . then it is the Warden who will receive this information and then have to relay it as quickly as possible to all the volunteers in the area. We also hold a special medical kit with far more medicines than the standard First Aid Kit each volunteer has, and even a surgical kit that we will have to deliver to a local hospital in the event a volunteer needs emergency surgery. We get some other nifty resources but I think I should use discretion and not mention them (for safety reasons).  I am the Talas assistant warden this year. Next year I will become the primary warden when the current one leaves. The current Warden is going to Greece for 3 weeks later this month, during that time I will be the acting Warden. Now that I am a volunteer there are a few other opportunities for service and committee membership. Several are sitting on boards that review grant applications, I may have interest there. But I probably wont go out for too much more. I may already be wearing myself too thin, not to mention that none of this actually has anything to do with my site where I am working. That in and of it’s self is going to be more than a full time job. Overachieving? Maybe. Surprised? Of course not! "

    "body": "2011/06/07 - A quick update on the last week of my life… The swearing-in ceremony was eventful, as expected. It was held in the national theater and the building had a perimeter of police that would make you believe the president was there. In fact, we did have the Ambassadors of both the USA and Japan present, along with many high-ministers and cabinet members of the Kyrgyz Government. About 500 people in total. The ceremony WAS broadcast on the internet, but we were provided with the wrong link. The correct link, where clips and be viewed on-demand, is here (I am in the front row sitting on stage, green shirt, purple tie): After the ceremony the Volunteers were bussed away to the PC Office (a very large, BEAUTIFUL compound) where we had a legit BBQ, complete with Dr. Pepper, Mug Root Beer and many other items that we were shocked to see here. There is a US military base 20 miles away and they donated these American delicacies to us to mark the occasion. Very nice of them. Now I am at my site in Talas City. My family is amazing. They are great at engaging with me and being patient with my limited language. My house resembles a Swedish spa mixed with a tropical garden. I have 3 flushing toilets, whereas many volunteers don’t have even one. I am WAY blessed in this regard. I do not miss Louisiana’s nasty summer at all right now. It is so super beautiful here. I took a nap in a gazebo in my family’s gardens yesterday and I felt like I could have easily been on a beach somewhere with a gentle sea-breeze. My job here is working with an awesome community-based radio station. I came to the office today and was handed about 5 pounds of paperwork, outlining how we are to spend a very large sum of money (that I can’t disclose) over the next two years in an cumulative project called “Helping Women by helping Men: Media Campaign on Domestic Violence Prevention. ” These funds derive from a grant of the European Union that we were awarded last week. They want me to implement many of the grant’s stipulations, which conveniently, is for a term of 2 years. This includes concerts, radio programs, seminars and various other community outreach programs. Very exciting! Language has picked up a lot now that I am at site. My office is so confusing because depending on who I am speaking with, I come in and out of English, German and Kyrgyz. They often speak Russian to each other and then I have no idea what they are saying. Many conversations here comprise of all 4 languages with various people translating for each other. Its a very interesting situation. I am going to start looking for a language tutor next week. The PC will pay for this, so pending their approval I would like to have a Russian tutor and start on that. If they say yes, then I am going to ask someone at the German school here to do it. I think it would be really neat to LEARN Russian IN German. It might even make more since that way, because Russian and German grammar, and the use of cases, is very similar. Whereas the similarities with English are far and few between. Tomorrow I am going back to Bishkek for more training. I was selected for a camp called “Training of Trainers. ” After that I don’t have too many plans to depart from my site in the near future. All in all I am very happy here and things are going really really well. Everyone has a unique experience in the Peace Corps and I am discovering the accurateness of the PC’s slogan, “The Toughest Job You WIll Ever Love. ” Be good, stay in touch, and don’t be a stranger!

    "body": "2011/05/12 - I haven’t seen as many horses as I have seen today since I lived in Kentucky! I arrived in Talas City about 3 hours ago and had dinner (and tea, of course).  Dinner was amazing. . fresh veggies and fruits (both of which have been lacking in my diet) as well as an assortment of baked and meat-based foods.  It was all very delicious.  I have a host- mom and dad, 3 sisters age ranging from 7-20, 1 brother age 5+- and maybe another brother slightly older… family dynamics here are really hard to figure out!The younger sister played a violin concert for me.  She is quite good for her age!  Reminds me very much of my cousin Matthew when we were young.  The older sister pulled out all the stops with a belly dance.  I wasn’t expecting that at all! But she was also quite good at her talent. The house is HUGE, and the accompanying yard has vast gardens and beautiful landscaping. . the best I have seen in country.  There is an indoor bathroom with a sit down toilet (super rare!), a shower with hot water (even more rare!) and a swimming pool! (unheard of!)  The informal living room reminds me of Elvis’s Jungle Room.  I will send pictures later and you will no doubt see the similarities. Then the director for my NGO stopped by for about an hour.  She is super awesome and we are going to work together very well.  But to top off the whole night, the director is fluent in Kyrgyz and Russian (almost everyone here is), her English is quite good, but the BEST part is that she is fluent in German!  So we spent much of the night filling the Kyrgyz/Russian gaps with German which was just fantastic. The most important and epic character in all of Kyrgyz history/lore is named Manas.  He is the hero figure that united the Kyrgyz clans under one banner, defeated the Chinese and others and claimed Kyrgyzstan as the land for the Kyrgyz people.  Manas is from the Talas region and my new host family has given me his namesake as my nickname.  I can’t think of a higher complement a Kyrgyz person can give to another, especially to a foreigner. So day 1 in the new region was fantastic!  Tomorrow I see the office, meet the chief of police, mayor, and a few other key figures in the city that I should be acquainted with. The adventure never stops! "

Many of daily life customs and values are quite similar across the region, so it is worthwhile to read about neighboring countries as well.  Finally, you might also want to read Erica Marat’s book on the Tulip Revolution. She is a journalist, and has published other things that are available online. Madeleiene Reeves has also published some online articles about the second political coup in Kyrgyzstan.  The country is extremely beautiful, but there are serious economic problems which are further complicated by the problem of corruption.

Today I was visiting with Marguerite Constantine, the single most influential woman in my life aside from my mom.  Marguerite is the reason why any of this is happening.  She was the one that made it possible for me to go to Germany as a Rotary youth Exchange Student and from there all doors that have opened to me have been a result of the faith she had in me when I was 16. So I was visiting with Marguerite and husband Wes at their home and goat dairy ([http://www. WesMarFarms. com](http://www.

So the Feds are requiring that I get this shot, and are also the reason why I can not get the shot.  What a conundrum! Jason to the rescue again!  Turns out that Jason’s Czechian dance instructor is also the director of the public health clinic here.  The clinic already told me no-go on the shot, but Louisiana politics being what they are Jason was able to get me in through the back door and get the polio booster.  And at no cost. With that, I have now completed all that is required of me for the medical review.  I just need to get the Doctor’s at the VA to sign off on all of it and then get this sent in to the Peace Corps ASAP. Oh, interesting side story… As you know by now, Rotary is a big part of my life.  The flagship philanthropy of the Rotary Foundation is the eradication of Polio.  I have contributed to this cause for many years and now that I need a polio shot myself I had to go through hell to get one.  Funny how life works!

It was not until my return from a year in Germany as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student that I started to have a greater appreciation for the world around me. Exactly one year later I returned from a 6-month trip to Brazil. As my mother says, “Germany opened my eyes to the world and Brazil opened my eyes to myself. ” I have long since believed in a life of “Service Above Self,” the mantra of Rotary International, an organization that has done more for me than is deserved.  I have been an active Rotaractor on the local and international stage and I have spread the word of Rotary everywhere I have traveled and lived.  If I spend the rest of my life working for their cause it will not be enough to pay back this debt.  Luckily for me, they aren’t looking to cash in on anything.  This is just the way I feel! While I was in Atlanta as a lost soul trying to figure out the rest of life I found a job opening at the Rotary International headquarters in Evanston Illinois.  I applied right away and started reading about working for RI.  Among other interesting statistics, they listed that many of their multi-lingual employees were returned Peace Corps volunteers!  For me, that was all I needed to read to remind me that serving in the Peace Corps could be much more than just part of a political path.  Its not about politics, and for that I am glad.  It is about serving others.  Hopefully in the process I will pick up the experience and credentials to be better suited to serve humanity for the rest of my life. It should also not go unmentioned that I would probably not have actually applied to the Peace Corps had I not first spent the first half of 2010 in Los Angeles.  While there I became friends with David B. , a Peace Corps Masters International participant.  He was in the program but was not yet started.  he talked to me a great length about the process and encouraged me to apply.  It is only now, months later, after reading about working at RI that it has finally clicked and I am filling out the extensive application.

This question has had great implication for me in the past.  When I found my soul a little lost after college, eventually I regained my happiness when I asked myself “what did you do for fun before college?”  The answer was easy: I spent every waking moment I could possibly spare at the community theater doing anything and everything. Remembering this I stopped trying to replicate my collegiate activities in the post undergrad world and instead returned to my community roots.  This was a great move and all rooted in the question, “What was the original Plan A?” Now I find myself faced with needing to ask the same question again.  And I have an answer. Since I was 17 years old my path has been one of politics.  I studied politics and foreign affairs in college with a desire to make a career in the United States Foreign Service. The Foreign Service is no easy career to get started in.  It is highly competitive and highly political.  As a result I have long since determined that the best way for me to start serving humanity and to give me a competitive edge in joining the Foreign Service was to first join the Peace Corps. By senior year of college I had a change in heart for politics.  I studied Political Science with a concentration in Foreign Policy.  However, as I was nearing graduation I couldn’t help but notice that all these other brilliant, politically-focused minds around me were, well, much more politically-focused than I was. While they were working in the governor’s office and conducting internships on Capital Hill I was obsessing over the organization of concerts and my job in event management with the LSU Athletics Department. The final final straw came when I took a class senior year title “Foreign Policy Decision Making. ”  While this should have been my absolutely favorite class from undergrad I actually came to loath it.  (as an aside, my favorite class was Business Law, followed by the History of Jazz) Then I was offered a job working in the music industry as a concert promoter and spent the next two years traveling the country with the biggest names in music.  A decision I will never regret.  It was the right thing at the right time.  And I will always carry those experiences and memories with me among my fondest. However, that came to an end and now here I am, a lost soul.  So what was Plan A? Oh, right: THE PEACE CORPS! The application process for the Peace Corps takes about a year and boy don’t I wish that I had applied a year ago so that I was departing now!  I don’t know what the next year will hold for me, but if the last year is any indication on how the next year is going to go, then applying for the Peace Corps today is probably a good Idea. Here I go. Wish me luck! JM "

    "body": "2010/06/06 - Photo Credit: Volkan Olmez Had I the opportunity to address tonight’s audience at the celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Rotaract Club of Southbay, I would have said this: Home Is Where The Heart Is: In 2006 I made my first journey to Los Angeles.   I was 1 of 6 delegates representing the Rotaract Club of LSU to the 2006 USCC Conference hosted at UCLA by Rotaract District 5280.   This is also when I was first acquainted with the Rotaract Club of Southbay and a few of their illustrious members: Cheryl, Claudia, Megan, Tori, Jonathan and of course, Roderick (to name a few). Ever since this trip, Los Angeles has always been on the horizon for me. . it has always just been a matter of time.   From this brief visit, I knew there was something special happening here, and I have been waiting for the opportunity to come be a part of it.  Finally, 4 years later, the stars seemed to align, and so I left my home in New Orleans, and headed west. Now, for those of you who know me at all, you may have taken notice that I have been blessed with the ability to travel a little.   In the last year alone, I have lived in 5 cities.   Each of them very significant and well worth my time there.   But none of them were home.   None of them could have my heart.   None of them had a strong Rotary Family. Upon attending my first Southbay event, a wetlands cleanup, I was immediately welcomed into the fold and my skills and ambitions put right to work.   I was finally being united with people who understand who I am and people that I find deserving of my time and admiration. Over the past few months I have become very involved, and even honored with leadership roles within the club and the district.   My ambition has been welcomed and fostered.   My skills have been put to work.   Good is being done. The past few years of my life have been the 3 most amazing post-graduate years I could have ever imagined.   I have known wonderful people, experienced diverse cities and cultures, and I have worked in more industries than most people will come to know in a lifetime.   I have been very lucky indeed.   Nonetheless, I have considered this period, ‘the Dark Ages of My Life,’ because they have been, more or less, without Rotary. I am so grateful to Southbay because I now have a guiding light.   The Dark Ages have come to a close.   My heart is becoming attached to a PLACE for the first time since I was 14 years old. Home is where the heart is.   My heart is with Southbay. Congratulations on 10 great years.   I look forward to being a part of the next 10. "

    "title": "Did It While I Was Young",
    "body": "2010/03/19 - “Do it while your young. ” I can’t tell you how many times I heard those words growing up. I heard them from family, friends, T. V. , people I aspired to be like, and everywhere in between. I don’t know how many times it took hearing it before it sank in, but sink in it did! In the past 10 years I have lived on 3 continents, in 4 countries, and in 12 cities. I am not a military brat. I am not a gypsy (though I might like to be one day!). I am not sketchy. I am certainly not running from anything or anyone. If anything, I am running to something, toward someone… though most of the time I don’t know exactly who, where or what that is. What I do know is that every time I make a move, it is smart. I am always strategic about it and I always make sure that my bases are covered on the other side. One day I might expose the stories behind all of my moves. Some were “just because. ” Others were for financial gain. Even others for fame. Once it was for love, but I moved on still after that. I love calling so many places home (see the list at https://www. judsonlmoore. com). I love that I can relate to so many people and the places that they call home. Truth be told, I don’t really have a home. “Home” is just a word to me. . it is a filler word for some great expression that I don’t yet know how to define. I did once have a home. It was in Kentucky, but that was 12 years ago. Am I searching for a new “home?” I don’t think so. I mean, I did watch the movie Up In The Air and was inspired to go shopping for luggage. (Yes, that really happened!) Anyhoot. I digress. “Do it while you’re young. ” That’s what they said. And they were right. I can’t keep this up. I will have to. . nay, WANT to, settle down some time. But I am not there yet. Not quite. More often than I care to think about, people express to me how they wish they “could” go off and do fun things like explore the world and move around gaining experiences and perspective. Sometimes these people have kids, are in school, married (or nearly so). And to them my heart goes out. They either missed the boat when they were young, or chose to do other things when they were young. There is nothing wrong in the choice, only in the regret. In all things, at all times, in all places, you must focus on the positive. Otherwise you will live a bitter life. Then there are people who are young, smart, degree in hand, nothing tying them down, and they say to me, “I wish I could go off exploring the world!” And to them I say DO IT. Then come the excuses: ALWAYS. “I have this job…” “My family is here…” “I don’t know where I would go…” “I don’t have enough money to move…” etc etc etc…  note: I am the child of 2 Southern Baptist preachers (yes, mom too!), and my dad is a brilliant academic. They have very noble professions and have led very happy lives. My parents are the best parents I know of and they have done everything for me, always… but I was reared as far from a silver spoon in my mouth as you can imagine. I have worked since I was 14 and as many as 5 jobs + college at a single time to get where I am today… and everything, EVERYTHING I posses is a result of my own work, not a trust fund. . so lack of money is not an excuse either. Just a reflection for lack of motivation and creativity.    :) Trust me. You don’t REALLY want to move around like I do. It takes real sacrifice. I have a belief that the long-term benefits will be great. That is what keeps me going. But it isn’t easy. If it WERE easy then everyone WOULD do it! (so they say) But if you want to explore the world. If you want this connectivity with different people and cultures, but don’t know where to start, then shoot me a note. I would love to talk about it. What I find is that it is hard to relate my stories and experiences. Most people don’t ‘get it. ’ Enough about that. I live without regrets. I love my life. I am just nearing a time when I want to share my super-awesome-crazy-experience-at-every-turn-know-more-people-than-Google-life with someone else. Now accepting applications. While I am still young.

    "title": "My Blogging Failure",
    "body": "2010/03/19 - When I was 8 years old my mom sat me down at the dinning room table, placed a composition journal in front of me and told me there would be no T. V. or playing until I wrote an ENTIRE half page of my thoughts.   She knew the importance of journaling. While my parents vary rarely made the really dumb mistakes that plague most child-rearing experiments, mom did this time: she thought that equating writing with the lack of fun activities, would be the best way for me to fall in love with the task. Of course, she was wrong. I pouted and complained and came with all sorts of witty reasons why I was unable to write and why running off to the den was a much more valuable use of my time.   It was futile.   Eventually I wrote a FULL page about how dumb I thought journaling was.   And for the next month, I wrote every night about how much I hated it. Eventually she got the point, and I was released from this torturous and mundane task.   She also told me that I would later regret not writing things down and that I would wish I had listened. Of course, she was right. So here I am, mid-20’s and I have never journaled, blogged, or otherwise gathered my thoughts in any one place (other than my brain).   During college I started to think about it from time to time.   I think I even bought a really nice journal, convinced that a leather-bound cover and gilded pages would help get the creative juices flowing.   Like I said, I “think” that happened. Point is, I have never been one for writing about me.   Certainly not as much as I like to talk about me! I don’t know what best to blog about.   I have been told that any writer starts off not knowing where to go, but as a read today, “The pace of your forward motion is not important.   What is important is that you are moving forward at all. ”  Wise words. I am a Facebook addict.   I Tweet so much that with the same effort I could probably cure cancer.   Now in my ripe old mid-20’s I look back and realize that getting one’s thoughts out there is a good thing.   And as much as I will still hate it like that malcontent 8 year old ginger kid I once was, I am going to at least make an effort. Wish me luck.   Happy Blogging. Don’t do evil. Be good. JM "

    "body": "2007/12/20 - photo credit: Calum MacAulay Goal setting is spoken about in an almost cliche way, which is too bad, because spending time in reflection about what you want out of life and writing down your life goals truly is an important thing to do and to review often. In the example below, I share my personal life goals which I wrote as I was finishing college. The exercise is quite simple to do and consists of just two parts. The first part is to identify the one overarching theme which you want your life to represent. What single thing do you most want to be able to say you did with your life (not just in your life). Perhaps it is easier to think about this point as what you most hope people will say about you in your memory. The second part is to identify 10 - 15 concrete actions which you will do to contribute toward the overarching theme. This is the content of your life. The things which you want to accomplish along the way. Do keep in mind that frequently reviewing and revising this list is very appropriate, even encouraged. We change as we grow older. We identify new ambitions and new passions, so it is natural that this list might change over time. Aas I like to say, even a bad plan is better than no plan, and the most important part of any plan is having the flexibility to change. Want more guidance with identifying your life goals?

    "title": "The Elgin Marbles - Should they be returned to Greece?",
    "body": "2006/02/07 - The prestige of the world’s finest museums is largely rooted in collections of stolen art.   There is a fair share of ‘home-grown’ art in national museums but there are also vast collections of artifacts that have been obtained by nations by forcefully removing them from their places of origin.   Frequently these acts are done during times of conquest when one nation has fallen to a greater power, and the taking from the weak is generally excepted as normal behavior under these circumstances.   However, there has rarely been an act of thievery so damaging to the history of a culture and carried out in such a unforgiving way than that of the removal of the Parthenon sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles. The Parthenon, built in Athens Greece around 450 BC, has seen many battles in its two millennia of existence (18).   Many of these battles have resulted in the desecration or remodeling of the building from its original form.   When the British conquered the Turkish occupants of Greece at the end of the 1700’s, the original Parthenon was in dire condition and only a fraction of the original site was still intact.   The statues adorning the roofline of the temple in the frieze were in good condition and the British occupants decided that they would make a great treasure, so they removed many of the pieces which were still in place there and took them back to England.   They remained in the private collection of Lord Elgin until 1816 when he sold them to the British Museum.   They have remained at the museum for almost two centuries under the care of the British despite Greeces repeated pleas to have the marbles returned. There are many arguments for why the marbles should be returned and just as many for why they should remain in Britain.   The book, The Elgin Marbles: Should they be returned to Greece, by Christopher Hitchens defends the Greek’s position for the return of the marbles, and I would have to agree with the author’s position.   It seems that the argument for the marbles’ return is strong enough to warrant the gifting of the marbles back to the Acropolis.   I think that it would be much in England’s favor to return the marbles generously so that they ay be in a position of praise, as opposed to criticism. Lord Elgin began planning the movement of the marbles in 1799 when he became the British ambassador to Constantinople (24).   Once here, he commissioned two men, William Hamilton and Giovanni Battista to assist with the planning.   William Hamilton was to assist with the political alignment for the approval of the marbles’ removal.   Giovanni Battista was an artist who was hired to illustrate the removal (and related) process as it occurred (25). The first step toward removal was for Elgin and his team to acquire a _Firman, _which is a formal document from the Turkish document which expresses official permission for the removal.   The Firman which was acquired was legal and legit, but it was very ambiguous and allowed for Elgin to abuse the actual intentions of the Turks, “When they wish to take away some piece of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto” (27). During the removal process, great damage was caused to the pieces removed from the Parthenon.   In order to safely package and ship the statues many of the pieces had to be cut, this in its self was of course very destructive despite the great effort taken to make cuts where it mattered least.   There were also a good number of pieces being carried aboard the ship, Mentor, which sank in the Mediterranean.   All of these pieces were recovered, but this still illustrates the great risk which was taken in removing these marbles from Greece (32-4). When the marbles first arrived in England, Lord Elgin had them put on display in a building adjacent to his residence on Park Lane in London.   This is where the marbles stayed in limited public view for more than a decade (36).   The cost of the display was very much worthwhile to Lord Elgin, however, the cost of upkeep and other related expenses was a great drain on his financial assets.   Needless to say, passing the marbles on to the British Government would have been much more practical, but for Lord Elgin, it was more important for him to retain his treasure (37). The British Parliament tried for years to purchases the marbles for £$30,000 but Elgin was holding out for a sum closer to £63,000 (38).   Finally, in 1816 an agreement was reached where the marbles would be purchased for £35,000 with the conditions that the exhibit forever be called, “The Elgin Marbles,” be housed in the British Museum and always open for inspection by Lord Elgin, and that all persons to ever acquire the status of Rank of Earl of Elgin be added to the trustees of the British Museum (43).   Now, for almost two centuries, the marbles have remained at the British Museum on public display and the only controversy left over the situation is getting them out of that museum, and brought back to their place of origin atop the Parthenon. There are many arguments for why this should and should not be done.   Amongst the more popular arguments it is said that the, “removal of the marbles to Britain was boon to the fine arts and the study of the classics” (72).   There is no recourse for this argument.   It is certainly true that many people of been inspired by the marbles, and that many more people have had access to see them in the British museum than they would have if the marbles still adorned the Pantheon.   However (the argument goes), this is not justification for defacing the greatest artistic and architectural masterpiece that has ever existed.   It is stated in the book, and quite rightly so, that even though more people have seen them in the British Museum than would have on the Parthenon, then wouldn’t also be true that even more inspiration could be had from the marbles if they were on display in Disneyland (75)?  I for one think that would look a little odd at any Disney resort, but if the purpose of art is to educate and inspire, then maybe moving them to Disney is actually a good idea.   Besides, who needs the inspiration more than the world’s children? Additionally, it is argued that the marbles are safer in London than they had been, or would be, in Athens.   The book points out that there is no way to know the course of history which was not taken.   The marbles could have been just fine to remain in Greece, or not.   No one will ever know (75).   The author does point out two times (in 200 years) that the marbles where endangered in London:  the first in 1938 when it was discovered that the cleaning method being used on the sculptures where causing harm to them (mainly the heads of the Horses of the Sun) (78).   The other instance in which the marbles were put in harm way was in 1941 when Hitler’s air force had a successful bombing raid on London which severely damaged the gallery where the marbles were on display.   Luckily, the marbles had been moved just in time to an offsite storage facility which was considered to be safe (which it was) (78). With Athens being in the current environmental state that it is, there is also concern that the marbles should not be exposed to the toxic and polluted air at the Acropolis.   This is viewed as the strongest argument on the retentionist’s side because the oxidation which could occur to the marble would have severe and irreversible consequences (79). Finally, the most interesting argument for the retention of the marbles in London is that to return them would set a president for returning artifacts with foreign origin.   The thing that makes most people disagree with this argument is that the Elgin Marbles are not just any artifact, they are rather pieces of a masterful whole which is probably the greatest cultural symbol and significant achievement in western civilization.   The reunion of these pieces in particular would not justify the return of other ‘stand alone’ artifacts.   Besides these marbles represent such a world-wide symbol of importance and history, an exception can be made to (properly) reunite them to their origin because it is in that fashion that the world will most be able to appreciate them (83-90). Whether or not you believe that pieces of one’s heritage belong in their places of origin, it seems that in the case of the Elgin Marbles it would be most proper to have them not as a piece, but as a whole of the original design of the Parthenon.   That leaves us with two options: disassemble the Parthenon and bring it to Britain, or return the marbles to their proper home atop the Acropolis.

    "title": "Does Oil Hender Democracy?",
    "body": "2005/12/06 - The Article, Does Oil Hender Democracy, by Michael Ross, examines why the generally excepted theory that economic growth fosters democratic rule fails in countries where the main economic stimulator is from oil production.   The Middle East, Central Asia, and Venezuela all share two things in common: they are all major oil-producing countries and they all have non-democratic regimes.   Ross structures his paper by studying three aspects to the, “oil-impedes-democracy” claim. The first of these aspects is testing whether or not a claim is valid.   For instance, it is difficult to test a claims validity when there are no variations upon which to test it against.  The example Ross gives us is that of countries in the Middle East which produce few scholars with multiple dependent variables; the dependent variable of course being regime type.   In the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, all regimes have been authoritarian since gaining independence.   Since few countries in the Middle East have every experienced any regime which was not authoritarian, it is difficult to test any theory using regime type as the dependent variable in the Middle East.   Because of this, it can be said that there are other factors which determine regime type which are not economic, for instance, the fact that much of the Middle East is Islamic, greatly impacts the region’s culture. The Second thing Ross does is examine a claim along two dimensions: the first is geographic and the second is sectoral.   Ten of the 15 countries which are most economically oil-dependent are in the Middle East.   Almost all of these Middle Eastern countries are authoritarian, even the non-oil-producing countries, so we are posed with the question of whether or not oil impedes democracy in just the Middle East, or is it a world wide phenomenon?  Or does it have more to do with the culture of all the Middle Eastern countries? The other dimension, the sectoral dimension, looks at other natural resources other than oil in other countries and determines if they have similar effects in countries which are dependent on them.   Much of the world’s fuel supply is concentrated in the Middle East but many of the non-fuel minerals are widely dispersed throughout the world.   IT must also be examined as to whether or not these other minerals have similar effects on hindering democracy, or if this is an oil-specific trait. The final aspect Ross explores is the question of causality.  That is to discover if oil does indeed have anti-democratic effects, what is the inherit cause of that?  Ross tests three possible explanations: First, a “rentier effect” which is when a resource-dependent countries has low to no taxes of its’ citizens so that it can evade responsibility for the people.   Secondly is an examination of a “Repression effect”, which states resource-wealth slows social and political development by allowing governments to finance security measures instead of social programs.   Thirdly, Ross tests a “modernization effect”, which states that the production of oil as a main economic source does not contribute to the social and cultural growth which is required to maintain in order for democracy to thrive. The rest of the article uncovers four things.   First is that the claim that oil ay impede democracy is valid and there is plenty of data to support the theory.   Ross finds that oil has a much higher impeding effect in poorer countries than in rich ones.   He also finds that the amount of oil a country may export or import has a great effect on the democratization of that state. Second, oil-impedance of democracy is in fact not restricted geographically to the Middle East.   Ross believes that oil has also played a factor in sustaining authoritarian regimes in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Nigeria. The third discovery is that non-fuel mineral-rich countries do suffer from the same occurrences of democracy hindrance as the oil-rich countries.   This goes to prove the theory that in markets such as these where the employment base is largely in the manual-labor field, the possibility of cultural and social development which would foster a democracy-demanding citizenship. The fourth and final result of Ross’s study is that there are at least three causes for the oil-impendence property of oil.   They are: the rentier effect, a repression effect, and a modernization effect. This paper compliments many of the previously discussed theories of Biox and Stokes, which state economic development has a direct effect on democratic development and stability.   Although here these oil-rich nations have abundant wealth, the social capital does not exist, and the economic powers are not shared with the citizenship of the state.   Although many resources are being produced, the money stays exclusively amongst a select few and had zero trickle-down to the people. The fact that Ross studied the anti-democratic effects of non-fuel minerals in other parts of the world was significant.   I think that oil gets so much attention for two reasons; first, almost everyone in the world, especially first world, uses oil products everyday; second, because such a high percentage of oil-producing countries are in the Middle East, these countries are able to unite as a greater political force in the world than the other non-fuel mineral countries.   This justifies that the Middle East have greater attention because they are able to make greater demands and back up actions with stronger alliances.   It is also because of this alliance of Middle Eastern countries that they are able to carry out their own form of governments without foreign influence, and control the price of the oil which they produce.

    "title": "The Decision that Saved the World -  An Analysis of the Decision-Making Process during the Cuban Missile Crisis",
    "body": "2005/12/02 - During the thirteen-day period from October 18-29, 1962, the world stood and watched as the United States and USSR nearly entered into a war which could have resulted in world-wide nuclear holocaust.   The end result of the showdown was the extraction of Soviet nuclear presence in Cuba in exchange for the removal of US nuclear weapons in Turkey and a continued quarantine against Cuba which is still in place to this day.   There were many events during this thirteen-day period which nearly set off a war but thanks to the diligent decisions made by both President John F. Kennedy and Russian Premier Khrushchev, nuclear war was avoided. The Kennedy administration played a key roll in avoiding catastrophe by adhering to a process which considered all options, outcomes, and available information.   To understand the decision-making process, we must first evaluate the people who were of influence.   The Kennedy administration formed the Executive Committee (ExComm), “which brought together a number of NSC members plus others… who were not national security specialists but had the confidence of the president. ” [1]  There were 71 official members, but the most important are as follows: To try and detail the input of each of these people would easily fill a book, so for the practical purposes of this paper we will focus on a few of the most influential and polarized members of the ExComm. George Ball was the Under Secretary of State and a great advocate for the quarantine.   He lobbied for caution in ordering any type of military action because there was no way to know what minor act could be enough to trigger the Soviets into launching a missile.   Secretary Ball continuously held the position that any air strike or invasion of Cuba might have irreversible consequences.  He was a great critic of those who supported such ideas. The Secretary of the Treasury was Douglas Dillon.   Secretary Dillon was a man of great influence and experience in regards to international nuclear politics.   Under the Eisenhower administration, Dillon served as the Ambassador to France where he was the go-between while negotiating whether or not the US would provide nuclear weapons in Vietnam on behalf of the French (which the US refused to do).   Secretary Dillon was very much in favor of military action in Cuba and advocated it as such. Theodore Sorensen was Kennedy’s Chief of Staff who was responsible for drafting many of the president’s notes and speeches.   If there was ever a man in a gate-keeping position between ExComm and the president it was this man.   Sorenson was in favor of the quarantine but was careful in keeping all options on the table. The Assistant Secretary of Defense was Paul Nitze.   Nitze was a believer in the American military superiority over Cuba and the Soviets, of which there is probably no doubt, and was very eager to use military force to show the strength of the US.   He felt that not acting with force was to show weakness.   He believed that the Russians would not enter a nuclear war because we greatly outnumbered and out strategized them on all levels of nuclear capacity.   He also headed the task force which planned for a response to Soviet action in Berlin. General Maxwell Taylor was the Army Chief of Staff and chairman of the JCS.   He was a self-proclaimed hawk of ExComm and advocated military action in Cuba. By far, the most important three people in this decision-making process were Secretary of Defense McNamara, Special Assistant Bundy, and President Kennedy.   Secretary McNamara, a Harvard graduate, was a brilliant strategist and understood the importance of institutional organization.   He was an initial advocate for military action in Cuba, but after review of the situation and a few days of deliberation, McNamara switched to fully supporting the naval blockade. McNamara was one of Kennedy’s most trusted advisors and was extremely influential in encouraging Kennedy to stay the course with the quarantine.   In his capacity as Secretary of Defense, McNamara’s main role was to control the military and make sure they obeyed the order of naval blockade with minimal action.   Many military leaders were eager to execute military operations, but with McNamara’s superb leadership he was able to restrain action. McGeorge Bundy was the President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs.   During the thirteen day period of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bundy switched is stance on what the most appropriate response to the Soviets was many times.   Initially he supported an air strike, then the quarantine, and then exhibited passiveness to the whole situation.   Although this was extremely frustrating to the president and members of ExComm, he served as an example of how no single option could be chosen without considering all possibilities, and that was important.   Although Bundy could not settle on a choice, he did believe, “the choices were either direct military action, which he considered ‘intolerable,’ or learning ‘to live with Castro, and his Cuba,’ and adjust policies accordingly. ” [2] During the crisis, Bundy lobbied for responding to only the first letter (out of two) from Soviet Premier Khrushchev and ignoring the second one all together.   He was also a voice in support of not publicly exchanging the US missiles in Turkey for the Soviet ones in Cuba.   He felt that if this information was made public it would make the US seem weak and hurt relations with their NATO allies. President John F. Kennedy was undoubtedly the most important figure on the US side of the Cuban Missile Crisis.   An experienced and well versed politician, JFK understood the importance of information gathering and moving cautiously forward in this delicate situation while all possible options could be considered.   Kennedy had been in secret communications for months with the Soviets and had been promised specifically that the Soviets would not ever build missile launch sites in Cuba.   “When the president learned… about the character of the Soviet buildup, he felt both betrayed and politically threatened. ” [3]  Moving forward, Kennedy pulled together his most trusted and brightest advisors to form the ExComm which would together find a way to resolve this issue peacefully. As can be seen from these brief biographies of the most influential members of the ExComm, there was a diversity of specialists and opinions which were considered throughout the crisis.   This diversity was part of what JFK valued most in working through the decision-making process.   The ExComm as a group had great access to outside information and consulted the UN and Congress on many issues.   JFK was definitely not a biased leader on this issue as can be gathered from his desire to have so much input and diversity of opinions.   The ExComm had a realistic view of the situation and understood that making a bad decision could end in nuclear war, something to which no one is invulnerable. They also had a great base of experience from people who had dealt with international relations in the past, including current and past ambassadors. It can be argued that the ExComm didn’t gather all the information which existed, but I think that they realized that fact, and was a factor in the decision making process.   In realizing that more information was out there to be gathered and that more options may present themselves given time, I believe that Kennedy opted for the quarantine because it bought time to gather more information.   If a military action had been the first course of action then the situation would have been outside the control of any of the decision-makers. These people can be generally classified into two groups at the beginning of the crisis: hawks, who want US military action in Cuba, and doves, who want to pursue diplomatic measures and implement a quarantine zone around Cuba.   Some of these peoples’ initial beliefs change over the thirteen-day period and in the end it is the doves which win out.   Over the next few pages I will outline a brief time line of the major events during this 13-day period which had significant impact on the decision-making process to implement and maintain the quarantine around Cuba, as opposed to initiating military action. Thirteen days passed from the onset of the Kennedy/ExComm involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but the first reconnaissance photos of the missile launch sites were taken by a U-2 spy plane on October 15, 1962. October 16 – Day 1 [4]**  **President Kennedy receives news of the missile sites in Cuba while having breakfast.   He immediately calls together his Ex-Comm to start discussing the American response to this news. October 17 – Day 2 Kennedy meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrie Gromyko and informs him that the US will not except the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba.   This meeting is held in secret and the public is not yet made aware that this situation exists. October 18 – Day 3 Ex-Comm meets to discuss the situation and many members polarize to recommendations of military action (air strikes or invasion) or to enforce a naval blockade (quarantine).   Dean Acheson initially supports military action while Robert Lovette and McGeorge Bundy advise that a quarantine would be best.   As conversations developed, many members of ExComm came to believe that the quarantine option was in fact the best thing to do at least for now and that any military action may be too rash and have irreversible, long-term consequences. October 19 – Day 4 Balancing scheduled campaign appearances for the public with behind the scenes planning with ExComm, Kennedy leaves for Ohio and Illinois.   Before leaving on his trip, Kennedy meets with Secretary of Defense McNamara and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   The JSC reports an initial agreement on an air strike in combination with a quarantine, but expresses concern that there was no guarantee that all missile sites could be destroyed and the political repercussions could be great. Kennedy points out that to act in Cuba would justify a Soviet response in Berlin which is something that needed to be avoided at all cost, and US troops in Germany were not positioned to defend American interests there.   Air Force Chief of Staff LeMay states that a quarantine without military action would be a sure step toward war and that military action was the only possibility.   Kennedy refutes by saying that if we take action the Soviets will too and they are in too many superior positions in sensitive areas that we care about around the world, like Berlin. October 20 – Day 5 Kennedy returns home early from the campaign under the excuse of an upper-respiratory infection so that he can meet with the ExComm and try to find a suitable alternative to military action. October 21 – Day 6 This day is a turning point in the decision-making process.   New intelligence gathered from a U-2 flight shows that there are many more missile sites along the northern shores of Cuba as well as fleets of Cuban bombers poised for attack at a moments notice.   Estimates show that 10-20 thousand casualties could result from air-strikes and since not all of the missile sites could be taken out there would certainly be retaliation from the Soviets.   Kennedy firmly decides on a naval blockade only for the time being. October 22 – Day 7 In a meeting between JFK and his brother, Robert Kennedy pledged his support of the quarantine.   “I was one of the strongest backers of this strategy because it signaled our resolve but gave Khrushchev room to back down and increased the probability of achieving our objective without catastrophic military action. ” [5] President Kennedy addresses the public and informs the world of the situation and his decision to implement only a naval blockade with an impending military strike if further provoked by the Soviets.   Many congressional members urge Kennedy to order air strikes but he does not.   Kennedy sets the military alert level to DEFCON 3.   All Cuban forces are mobilized in response and prepare to defend Cuba in the event of invasion. October 23 – Day 8 The Organization of American States votes unanimously to support the naval blockade.   With this support, Kennedy orders ships into place and the blockade is established by nightfall.   McNamara reviews plans to retaliate against Cuba and Soviet positions in the event that an American plane is shot down while conducting reconnaissance flights.   Kennedy agrees that any Surface to Air Missile (SAM) site which fires on an American plane will be destroyed and a warning be issued that upon a second instance the US will destroy all Cuban SAM sites.   Bundy suggests that Kennedy relinquish authority to attack any SAM site if deemed necessary by those in the field.   Kennedy agrees under the condition that there is irrefutable evidence that a plane was shot down, not just crashed due to mechanical errors. The president submits the official Quarantine Proclamation which states the rules and justifications for the naval blockade.   The ExComm anticipates that violence will break out when the US tries to board a Soviet ship, but it is a risk they will have to take.   Bundy disagrees with this stating that the Soviet ships are small in comparison to ours and resistance is not likely. October 24 – Day 9 Soviet ships reach the quarantine line for the first time, but hold their positions just outside the line as ordered by Moscow.   Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) and JFK discuss the political implications of this situation and agree that to have taken any less of an action would have resulted in impeachment and that to take a greater action could result in war.   It seems that Khrushchev is happy that this could be an embarrassing situation for Kennedy before the approaching congressional elections.   The Kennedys both believe that the Soviet ships will try to break the barricade, but they still are not sure what the best course of action in that instance would be. Dean Rusk, JFK, and Senator Everett Dirksen meet with congressional leaders to discuss the implications the Cuban situation has on Berlin.   Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield expresses concern that no military action is a small military action, and that any type of forceful retaliation towards the Soviets will justify any equal action they may take in Berlin.   He states that to attack in Cuba is to give up Berlin, and that is something that no one in the Western World will tolerate. October 25 – Day 10 The US ambassador to the UN, Adlai Stevenson, confronts the Soviet delegates about the situation but they refuse to discuss the matter.   Kennedy changes the military alert to DEFCON 2, the highest it has ever been in US history.   “Unprecedented actions were taken by the U. S. Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC was generated to still higher alert, DEFCON 2, for the first time ever, on October 25. ” [6] UN Secretary General U Thant proposes that, “there should be a voluntary suspension on behalf of Russia to all arms shipments to Cuba and at the same time a suspension of the quarantine measures involving the search of ships. ” [7] Kennedy refuses this proposal and will not consider any such action so long as the missiles are still active. A tanker ship, the Bucharest, approached the quarantine line and ExComm starts discussions on what the consequence of allowing it to pass unchallenged would be.   After it is blocked by a US destroyer, it proves that it carries no cargo restricted under the quarantine and is allowed to continue to Cuba with a US escort ship.   The question arises of what the significance of this is, and it is decided that a Soviet ship is going to have to be stopped and restricted sometime very soon to prove that the quarantine is real. McNamara and Kennedy both believe that permitting this ship’s passage does not weaken their stance because it was deemed within the restrictions to pass, but both feel that a ship with offensive weapons needs to get stopped to show the US means business. JFK states that the quarantine could be lifted if the UN could guarantee that no new missile materials be delivered to Cuba.   Bundy and McNamara strongly oppose this because the missiles that are already there would still be active and that is unacceptable.   Kennedy agrees with this point and from this day on refuses to accept any negotiations which do not include the dismemberment of all missiles in Cuba. The final order of business for the day is that POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) be added to the restriction list in Cuba, because these material aid in the building and completion of the missile sites. October 26 – Day 11 Soviet Premier Khrushchev sends a letter to President Kennedy stating that he would dismantle his Cuban-based missiles if the US would publicly promise to not invade Cuba.   Khrushchev also proposes that the US should remove its missiles from Turkey.   RFK and Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin meet secretly and with permission from JFK decide that the removal of Turkey-based US missiles is an acceptable negotiating platform. At the same time as this is going on, Fidel Castro of Cuba sends a message to the Soviet Premier requesting a nuclear strike against the US in retaliation for a US-led invasion of Cuba.   Secretary Dillon reaffirms his belief that an air strike against Cuba is still in order and that it is a far better alternative to a sea-based confrontation. JFK asks for the US ambassador to the UN’s opinion on how to proceed with this issue in the UN.   Ambassador Stevenson responds with a two-part plan.   First, all parties involved should agree to a three-day standstill where there would be no naval action in the Gulf.   During these days the progress in building the missiles would cease and they would remain inactive.   Second, negotiations could thus continue and Cuba would need to agree to complete removal of their presence in Cuba, guaranteeing no anti-Cuban action, and being flexible in agreeing to remove Turkish-based missile sites. CIA Director John McCone argues that under no circumstances should the quarantine around Cuba be dropped as part of the negotiation. Kennedy finds the middle ground, “Well now, the quarantine itself won’t remove the weapons. So you only get two ways of removing the weapons: one is negotiate them out, in other words trade them out, and the other is to go in and take them out. I don’t see any other way you’re going to get the weapons out”[8] October 27 – Day 12 A U-2 spy plane is shot down over Cuba, but despite the earlier decision about the SAM site, JFK did not issue a strike order.   On this same day the CIA reports that at least five MRBM missiles are fully operational in Cuba.  “Later evidence indicated that some of the MRBMs were indeed ready to fire by October 21 and that all of them were ready to fire by October 27. ” [9] Khrushchev announces publicly that he is willing to peacefully trade the Soviet missiles in Cuba for the US ones in Turkey.   This forces the Kennedy Administration into making a final decision.   Many members of the ExComm agree that taking any military action in the light of a peaceful solution would not be looked well upon by the public.   To be on the brink of nuclear war and do anything that might push the situation over the edge when being offered a peaceful way out would be an unreasonable decision.   In addition, since it is the Russians who have first publicly offered these reasonable terms for peace, breaking away from this offer would allow the Soviets to move on Berlin and justify it since they could claim they were not the aggressor. October 28 – Day 13 An agreement is made between the US and the USSR which states the US will not invade Cuba and the US will remove its missiles from Turkey within a reasonable amount of time.   In exchange the Soviets agree to remove all of their nuclear assets from Cuba and allow for UN supervision of the missile dismantling.   Cuba also agrees to not publicly announce that the missiles in Turkey were a part of the deal. Premier Khrushchev makes a radio address in Moscow stating that he will remove Soviet presence from Cuba.   He fails to mention any trade in regards to Turkey and the Cuban Missile Crisis comes to an end. Nuclear war has been avoided and the US has triumphed over the Soviets.   The decision-making process in the Kennedy administration had once fallen to the bad outcomes associated with Group Think, but after the Bay of Pigs incident JFK revamped his decision-making process to encourage dissent and critical evaluation among his team. In the Cuban missile crisis, virtually the same policymakers produced superior results. ” [10]  It seems that had the Bay of Pigs fiasco not occurred, the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis may have been much different and the earlier sentiments to apply force in Cuba may have had a better chance at occurring. In Conclusion, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the US dangerously close to nuclear war with the Soviets, but with some diligent decisions and actions the world was spared this worst-case scenario.   The analysis on whether or not this was the best process is a whole other topic, but it can be argued that continuing to punish Cuba for their involvement in this crisis is excessive and unjust.   Whichever way you may feel about the treatment of Cuba, it should be agreed on by everyone that it is a small cost to pay for avoiding nuclear holocaust.

    "body": "2005/11/26 - The American Red Cross was chartered in 1905 by the American Congress to, “carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods, and other great national calamities, and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same. ”  The American Red Cross plays a substantial roll in the United States and the world in providing assistance to victims of disaster (clients), and other agencies which are involved in disaster situations (firefighters, FEMA, police, etc…) Here in Louisiana the Red Cross most recently played a huge roll in the relief efforts from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through financial assistance, providing shelter, medical supplies, and handing out hygiene products, including toothbrushes and soap.   Although the Red Cross has recently gotten so much attention in this area because of their participation after those great storms, there is so much more that they do.   In fact, responding to huge natural disasters is only a small and geographically concentrated part of the roll they play nation-wide in the field of Disaster Services. The Red Cross works over 70,000 disasters.   Many of these are house and apartment fires.   Whenever a family (or person) is made homeless, either temporarily or indefinitely, the Red Cross can be called in to offer financial assistance to help these people pay for shelter (hotel), get to a relative’s, or purchase some immediate/ short-term necessities like food and clothing.   The Red Cross also replaces any medicines that are lost due to disaster.   So long as the drugs are not in the narcotics class (codeine, morphine, etc…), the Red Cross can have the client’s prescriptions refilled at no cost to the client.   All in all, the main purpose of the American Red Cross is to provide assistance to their client’s to fulfill their immediate needs, and to find a since of normalcy as soon as possible. The Red Cross takes are of the other disaster relief agencies by providing them with food, medical needs, mental health needs, and shelter if need be. Although chartered by Congress, The Red Cross is not a government agency.   Rather, one of the purposes of the Red Cross is to be a non-governmental, non-political, non-partisan, and independent organization to be on disaster scenes.   The Red Cross is supported by private donations and controlled on a local level by executive boards, similar to most other non-profit organizations.   At the national level, general policy is created, and resources are maintained and directed as needed in the occurrence of a large-scale disaster.   When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita came across the Gulf States, the local Red Cross chapters were not responsible for maintaining the organization of relief efforts.   Instead, the national office set up a temporary headquarters, local to the affected area, and controlled resources locally. The American Red Cross plays a crucial roll in the implementation of disaster relief and resource management and distribution.   It is with their great assistance that police can concentrate on maintaining order, fire fighters can fight fires, and search and rescue teams can spend their time searching, while allowing the Red Cross to treat the wounds and needs of the rescued.

    "title": "A Comparison of Emergency Warning Systems",
    "body": "2005/11/26 - In a November 2000 report published by the executive Subcommittee on Natural Disaster Reduction, about Natural Disaster Information Systems, three different major disaster warning systems and their relative application and effectiveness were discussed.   These three were the NOAA Weather Radio, the Emergency Alert System, and GPS technology. The NOAA Weather Radio is one of the few broad-range warning systems which is exclusively government controlled and owned.   This system works by broadcasting a four to six minute long warning about weather hazards in certain area, and the looping it so that anyone can tune in and get the warning at anytime.   This radio network is a currently available in 90% of the United States, but is hindered by the fact that one must own a specific type of radio to decode its signal.   One of the implications this executive committee would like to see happen is that all radios be made compatible with the NOAA signal so that anyone can receive warnings from any radio, at anytime. Although the NOAA radio decoder can be purchased inexpensively, many people do not own one, and do not listen to it constantly waiting for a warning.   Doing this would enable many more people to be reached in times of danger.   One further hope of the committee is that the system could be made ‘smart’, so that radios could decipher your location in relation to the pinpointed location of the threat, and let you know which direction and what distance the threat is from you. So why is the NOAA system one of the few exclusively government owned and operated systems?  The answer is quite obvious, and that is the cost of communications networks.   There are so many networks already in place, to build another, new one, would be both extremely expensive, and take a long time to create.   For this reason, many warning systems are broadcast through privately owned networks like television and radio, but also include the internet, paging systems, cellular networks, and several others.   This public/private partnership is generally a good situation because the private industry has an interest in taking care of its customers, but can not originate a warning due to liability issues.   Allowing the government to issue warnings, and then having them communicated over the private networks, allows for private interests to be protected from liability issues, warns everybody’s constituents, and is cost-effective for the government. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is one example of these public/private partnerships.   The EAS’s main purpose is to allow a nation-wide level of communication for the President of the United States to communicate with the nation in times of need.   Rarely is it the President who actually uses this system however.   More typically, this system is used to issue warnings about dangerous weather on television and radio stations.   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandates that all radio and television stations be equipped with EAS deciphers and broadcasters.   The system works by automatically interrupting any signal produced from the station and transmitting instead a signal which is produced from NOAA or other governmental agency. One problem with this system is that it is not selective in who it reaches.   If a television or radio station broadcasts over a huge area, the warning may only need to be received by a small percent of the listeners, but everybody hears it.   There is a great concern with creating too much apathy by using this system too much when there isn’t a huge are that needs to get the message because of the fear that people will stop paying attention to the warnings when they never experience a reason for it in the end. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) systems are becoming more and more effective and available for use of a broad scope of applications.   Many businesses are starting to be able to afford this technology and use it as a means to track vehicle positions for example in freight and trucking companies.   Geologists and Meteorologists can use GPS to determine changes in geographical features, like water levels along the coast during a hurricane, or shifts in land masses during earthquakes.   Being able to determine the position of flood planes in respect to where hurricanes make landfall is important in being able to accurately predict who is going to be at the most risk of flooding.   GPS has a very broad scope of applications and can be useful to determine the location and movement of virtually anything at a real-time basis. During the incident of a chemical spill, there are three common scenarios.   Either the spill is in a factory or plant (point or origin) where there is specialized staff and equipment to deal with the situation, or in transit by water or roadway.   If a chemical spill occurs within a production or refinery facility, there is a rehearsed procedure for how to deal with the problem, and everyone in the area knows how to play out there roll.   If the chemical spill occurs at sea, the warning needs to go out to the coast guard, and appropriate governments in the affected area.   People should be taken off of beaches, and the waterway quarantined from civilian and non-rescue boats.   If the incident occurs on a roadway, things get much more complicated.   Here, you are dealing with people who are unfamiliar with procedures and hazards, and are not equipped to safely be in close proximity to them.   Roadways often are very busy with motorists and interrupting the flow of traffic opens up another set of hazards which come along with traffic jams.   To warn these people about what hazards are on the road way, it is best to employ local radio stations to make traffic alerts, send out alerts on CB-Radios, so that commercial truckers whose’ cargo may also be hazardous, may try to avoid the area.   Most important is to get the message to just the people in the immediate area, and the people who may be coming to that area.   This could most effectively be accomplished by using RBDS systems at the incident scene, which can transmit warnings with a range of just a mile or fraction of a mile, depending on what may be most appropriate.

    "body": "2005/11/15 - The main character and narrator is Oskar Matzerath. Oskar is a man who never grew up, literally. He stunted his own growth when he was three years old, at three feet. In the book he does grow an additional 13 inches. Oskar is known for never parting with his red and white lacquered tin drum, which he is constantly beating on. Oskar’s other unique characteristic is that he has an extremely high-pitched singing voice which has the ability to shatter glass. As Oskar grows taller, he also looses this glass-breaking voice. Oskar does not attend school, but tries to educate himself instead by studying the writings of Goethe and Rasputin. Jan Bronski isVincent Bronski’s son and Oskar’s mother. Oskar believes that Jan is his birth father. Jan is a sickly man who has such a history of illness that he is turned away from military service on numerous occasions. Jan is an employee of the Polish Postal Service in Danzig. He fights defending the post building from the invading Germans, but looses and is taken prisoner and eventually executed. Although Oskar believes Jan to be his real father, Alfred Matzerath is also considered his father in the book. During WW1, Alfred was shot in the thigh, and while in recovery he met Agnes Koljaiczek, who was a nurse. Agnes and Alfred got married after the war, Agnes is Oskar’s mother. Alfred is also a big supporter of Hitler during WWII. He is killed in the Russian takeover of Danzig after the war. Oskar looses his virginity to Maria Truczinski. She has a son named Kurt, who Oskar believes is his, but Alfred also thinks that it is he who got Maria pregnant. Maria and Alfred marry after Agnes dies; but after WWII Oskar and Maria run away together to West Germany. Klepp is a flautist who played with Oskar in his jazz band. Klepp is one of the few friends which Oskar receives visits from while in the mental institution. Gottfried von Vittlar is another friend of Oskar’s which visits him while in the mental institution. They became friends when Gottfried met Oskar while he was climbing his mother’s apple tree. Just after WWII. Gottfried’s most significant roll is that he turned Oskar in for the murder of Sister Dorothea. Oskar requested for Gottfried to do this even though he was innocent. _ The Tin Drum_ is written as the autobiography of Oskar Matzerath. Oskar is thirty years old when he writes this autobiography, and living in a mental institution is Düsseldorf Germany. The autobiography covers his entire life-span, and family history, which includes events from both WW1 and WWII, starting around the start of the 1900’s and concluding a few years after WWII. He starts the book off with a history of his grandparents, emphasizing that they are Kashubes, a race from eastern Europe which live in the Eastern Germany/Polish area, but are not ethnically related to either of those countries. His grandparents moved to Danzig Poland, where his mother, Agnes, was born and where the family takes up the grocery and food reparation business. They are generally successful at this. Oskar talks a lot about the interaction the family had with the other store owners in the city, and how those relationships affect the families’ situation, and Oskar’s life. The premise of the book is that Oskar has ‘decided’ at age three to stop growing at just three feet tall. This was catalyzed by a tin drum Oskar received from his mother. Along with this decision, Oskar acquires a unique vocal capability which allows him to sing at such high-pitched frequencies, he can actually shatter glass with his voice. This talent come in very handy for Oskar at time, but is abused at others. Using this voice assists Oskar with breaking and entering and protecting his drum from being taken away from him, which is key because Oskar refuses to ever be parted with the drum. Through the course of the book there are some rather strange occurrences which happen on behalf of Oskar’s unusual talents and drives. Oskar’s main obsession is with the red and white lacquered tin drum. He must always have a drum with him no matter what. He uses it as a tool to remember past events and people. He has to replace his drum very frequently because of his poor treatment of it (while playing) and because it is just a toy drum (thus isn’t built very well), but always gets the same type every time. Oskar has two “presumptive fathers”. Both Alfred Matzerath and Jan Bronski are believed to be Oskar’s father (one of them anyway). Alfred is Oskar’s mother’s husband, but she had a long-time affair with Jan, who is also her first cousin. Oskar’s physical handicap and his slight mental retardation suggest that incest could possibly be a factor. These two father figures could not hardly be more different in their views. Alfred is a member of the Nazi Party and a huge supporter of Hitler, Jan is a Polish Nationalist who is very anti-Nazi. His mother dies before WWII so he goes of to stay with Jan in Danzig, which unfortunately is the first city to be invaded by Germany. Jan is part of the resistance of the Nazi’s but after the Nazi’s take the city, Jan is captured and executed, leaving Oskar all alone. At this time, Alfred gets remarried to Maria Truczinski, who is also Oskar’s first love. They get married because Maria is pregnant, and they think Alfred is the father. But this isn’t true, Oskar is actually the father, but nobody knows this until the baby, Kurt, is born, and then it is obvious who the father is. Unfortunately for Oskar (and probably fortunately for everybody else), Kurt refuses to have anything to do with Oskar, especially circum to Oskar’s wish that Kurt would have an equal fascination with drumming as he does. Baking up just a minute, it is important to note some of the activities Oskar did during the war. He finds a group of entertainers who he fits right in with, they are all midgets, and perform some form of ludicrous entertainment. This serves as a channel through which Oskar can drive his drumming and glass-breaking ability, and get a positive return for it. They go about the front-lines of the war and entertain the soldiers there until the allied invasion of France. This invasion breaks up the performers, and Oskar goes back home. While at home Oskar becomes a member of a group of youths which call themselves “The Dusters. ” They are a group which is not necessarily anarchist, but they are not in favor of any type of highly-structured beurocratic organization. Using his voice, Oskar and The Dusters break into government buildings and churches. Alfred is off fighting for the Nazi’s on the Russian front, and is killed in battle there. This allows for Maria and Oskar to be together, and forces them to take Kurt and move to Maria’s sisters in Düsseldorf. Here the family take up a variety of jobs including modeling for artists, trading on the black market, and engraving tombstones. All this just ties them over until Oskar starts up a jazz band which plays at a local nightclub. They become very successful at this night club, but it gets shut down when the owner dies. When the owner dies it is suggested that they should not stop playing, but rather go on tour. So Oskar and the band start playing at other regional venues and gets the exposure necessarily to be offered a recording contract. The recordings of the band’s music are extremely popular, and the band gets rich off of the deal. Oskar stops playing the drums very abruptly when the owner of the record company dies. He handles his grief by going out to the country and being alone. While out there, he finds the remains of a nurse he had known who was murdered. He takes her ring and ring finger, and eventually has a friend, Vittlar, turn him in for her murder. Oskar is wrongfully convicted of the murder but pleads insanity, thus he ends up in the mental institution where he writes this ‘autobiography. This book is so confusing to read! At every turn there is a love affair or a death and remarriage. It seems like Oskar falls in love with every woman of significance he comes across. I am curious is this is supposed to amplify the theme of his immaturity. On some levels it seems like the author is trying to tell us that anybody can be successful. Through so many unlikely events, this handicap, immature, unfortunate person becomes rich, famous, in love, and one of the few survivors of WWII from the original characters in the book. On the other hand Oskar is portrayed as the guy who just never gets it. He has himself sent to the mental institution because he is tired of all the drastic changes, and just wants to be somewhere where others will take care of him, and he wont have anymore worries. I think this is a conflict in plot and makes the book hard to understand, or get a significant meaning out of in the end. Such a complex character list is hard to effectively bring across in a book while maintaining both significance, and the reader’s memory, but I think the author did a good job with this here, mostly due to the fact that all the significant characters would die off and be replaced with new names. In conclusion, I am not really and totally sure what the author is trying to tell us here, rather than just the story its self, for its entertainment value. Because of this I would have to say that he fails at conveying this message, at least to a reader like myself, which for his credit, I usually don’t understand the deep plots and symbolic significance in books anyway, so it might just be my shallowness which is unable to comprehend his genius. The book was kind of funny, and sad at the same time, but I feel that all the love triangles and entering and exiting of characters is just too confusing and too much to try to juggle in a book which just holds a leisure reading value.

    "title": "Four Technologies of Disaster Management",
    "body": "2005/11/10 - When working in a disaster there are many resources and available technologies to help managers coordinate relief efforts.   Some of the key technologies include mapping, aerial photography, information management, and logistics.   The following is a brief review of these four areas and how their proper implication in the disaster management field can make a difference in saving lives. Knowing the geographic features of the effected area are extremely important.   Having reliable maps is key to planning the distribution of resources and people, as well as determining what obstacles are likely to be in the way of getting to those locations.   There are many different types of maps which can be used to asses the area: topographic maps, geologic maps, hazard maps, demographic maps, and hurricane tracking maps.  It is important to have both access to this reliable information, as well as have a proficient ability to read these maps. Computers are becoming extremely important in the mapping world.   With the implementation of technologies like GIS and GPS, precision calculations concerning location and elevation can be made.   This is important because it will help disaster managers to determine flood planes, geographic boundaries, and obviously location.   Computers are also starting to take a great roll in calculating at-risk locations in disaster-affected areas. A similar technology to mapping which is important is the use of aerial photography.   While maps can tell you where the geographic features of a place are as well as the human-made infrastructures, recent aerial photography will reveal what the current, post-disaster, situation is.   This information, when used in conjunction with maps, can be very useful in doing damage assessment, rescue planning, and reconstruction/cleanup. In all disaster situations there is a huge amount of information being shared and being dumped onto people.   Some of this information is important to the immediate needs of rescue, but lots of it deals with post-disaster relief.   All this incoming information can make difficult situations extremely confusing at a time when confusion already exists in excess.   The growing functionality and portability of computers over the last decade has made managing this information much easier.   Now all information can be routed to an off-site information hub and then routed to the proper people in the field.   This allows for faster transmission of information to the people who need to know it, and for less confusion and clutter of information.   This speed-up is important to conducting all aspects of disaster management, especially in search and rescue efforts. One final area which is important to technology in the disaster management field is logistics.   Like information management, logistics deals with the management of resources.   A disaster manager must be able to identify the barriers for getting needed supplies into areas and be able to accommodate alternative transportation methods of resources.   Through logistics, disaster managers are able to route the most need resources to the areas most in need of receiving them.

    "title": "Play Review - The Weavers",
    "body": "2005/10/31 - The Weavers, by Gerhart Hauptman, is a play about the suppressed weavers of Peterswaldu, Langenbielau, and Kaschbach, Germany.   This story tells about their efforts to liberalize themselves from the trappings of poverty and the social structure which keeps them there.   This struggle leads into a violent revolt which ends with innocent death.   Before the events of the play can be outlined in any detail, I will introduce a few of the main characters. Dreissiger is a local merchant and owner of a textile production company.   The weavers come to him once a week to sell him the cloth that they have made and to obtain new yarn in which to make more for the next month.   Dreissiger pays the weavers too little because he says that the cloth is not in high demand on the market.   Yet at the same time he is able to employ 200 additional weavers.   He uses the excuse that he is just trying to help, but in reality he is exploiting the workers. Pfeifer is the cashier for Dreissiger.   He is abusive of his power to pay the weavers as little as he wants and constantly bullies on them for not producing high-quality enough fabrics.   When the revolt begins, the weavers blame him for many of their problems because he has been so abusive towards them, and he represents the face of this abuse. Baecker is a weaver who publicly complains about the abuse and insufficient prices of the cloths from Pfeifer.   He is the first to stand up in objection to the unfairness of the weaver’s situations and is the reason why the weavers eventually rise up against Dreissiger. Jaeger is a German soldier and nephew of the weaver Baumert.   He sings a song to his uncle which encourages him to unite the weavers, and because of his military experience he is able to assist in the structure of the weaver’s organization and how they should plan to fight. Old Hilse is a weaver who remains neutral during the revolution.   He becomes an innocent victim of the revolt when he is killed by a stray bullet while he is weaving.   Old Hilse is the character which delivers the most of Hauptman’s message to the audience. The Weavers is a five act play.   The first act opens in Dreissiger’s house where weavers are lined up to sell their ‘webs’, or cloth.   They are receiving their payments from Pfeifer, which are extremely low, and Pfeifer is verbally abusing them and the quality of their work.   Weaver Baeker stands up against this treatment, especially about the excessively low prices and causes a huge scene.   The weavers start to align behind him in agreement, but Dreissiger enters and puts an end to the commotion and convinces Baecker to leave.   Just as Baecker is about to leave, a boy enters the scene and passes out on the floor.   This causes lots of panic and confusion amongst everyone in the room.   Dreissiger takes the boy into his office and puts him on the couch, giving him water to help him regain his strength.   Although Baeker has left, the point he made still lingers in the thoughts of those who remained.   The other weavers start to talk about it amongst themselves but Dreissiger interjects and explains to them that he is doing the best he can, that really cares about him, and that it is the market, not him, which is making the prices of the webs so low. In the second act we are introduced to the Baumert household where a few weavers are discussing their poor and tragic situation.   There are mixed beliefs about what the cause of their misfortune is, but they all agree that something needs to get done about it.   Jaeger, the nephew of the Baumerts enters.   He is in the German military and is well fed and has been able to escape the poverty of his family.   He tells of his new life and recites a song to the house which energized Old Baumert to organize the weavers against Dreissiger and those involved in the textile industry about them.   This song would be known as, “The Dreissiger Song. ” Act three takes place in a tavern called the Tap Room.   The weavers have congregated here to discuss their situation amongst each other and what they should do about it.   The climax of the scene is when Police Officer Kutsche enters the tavern.   The weavers take out a lot of their anger on him and Kutsche quickly realizes that this mob out numbers him and so he leaves.   Before leaving, he tells the weavers that they can no longer sing The Dreissiger Song, under penalty of the law.   In defiance, the weavers start singing the song as soon and Officer Kutsche leaves. The fourth act of the play takes place in Dreissiger’s house and starts off with a conversation between Pastor Kittelhause’s, his wife, a young man named Weinhold, and the Dreissigers.   Dreissiger is complaining about the song that the weavers are singing.   Weinhold is asked to leave the room when he tells Dreissiger that he thinks it is ok for the weavers to sing their song.   All the while, the weavers are gathering outside of Dreissiger’s house, singing the song and forming a protest against the way Dreissiger has been treating them.   Officer Kutsche and the chief of police enter with Jaeger as a prisoner, and try to coerce him into calming the growing mob.   Jaeger refuses to cooperate and is led into the street into the gathering.   Pastor Kittelhause goes to talk to the crowd and never returns.   The mob overruns the house, but not before Mrs. Kittelhause, the Dreissigers, and Pfeifer are able to escape. The fifth and final act starts off with Old Weaver Hilse praying quietly in his home.   He has not participated in the rioting and refuses to add to the trouble.   He stays at home instead and weaves.   The mob approaches his house.   It is being led by Jaeger, Baumert, and Baeker, and they try to get Hilse to join them, but he will have no part in this procession.   He tells them that what they are doing is wrong and that they should keep to their own way and weave, not rebel.   So without Hilse, the mob goes on to meet the German soldiers which have come to put them down and fighting ensues.   There are gun shots, and one of the bullets goes astray and tragically kills Old Weaver Hilse as he sits at his loom weaving. This play was pretty well written and I think adequately depicted some of the realities and struggles of the poor.   There was a real ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ type message being presented here.   These poverty-stricken people really have hit bottom and have no lives worth living.   They have no social means on which to improve their situations, or any way to advance economically.   Their only options are to die helplessly or to rebel against the social and economic institutions which suppress them.   Unfortunately, what happened in this play was that the rebellious were shot down, and the one that was complacent was made an innocent causality.

    "title": "The History of Events Surrounding the Camp David Accords",
    "body": "2005/05/05 -  Turmoil and unrest have been embedded as a day to day presence in the Middle East for much of history. This can be explicitly seen in the region being fought over between Jews and Arabs, now known as Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted in 1967 and has been the source of multiple wars, economic and cultural chaos, and the loss of countless lives. Throughout this conflict there have been many actors and many battle fields, but not much progress. The greatest progress was made at the intervention of the United States under the Jimmy Carter administration in 1978 which produced the Camp David Accords. These documents would spearhead negotiations for the following decades but would continue to prove that no foundation is truly sound enough to support or solve the conflicting views between the Israelis and Palestinians. On November 9, 1977, President Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt shocked the world in a speech to the People’s Assembly in Cairo when he declared that he was ready to talk with Israel. Eleven days later on November 20, 1977, Sadat made a historic trip to Jerusalem where he addressed the Israeli Knesset on behalf of not just Egypt, but rather he claimed to be speaking on behalf of the Arab world. Sadat wished that there would be peace between all those living in the Middle East, including between Arabs and Jews. Sadat however was not willing to claim an Arab defeat; rather he addressed whether Israel was willing to work toward peace, with Israelis and Arabs living together in harmony. “He also repeated a 20-year-old suggestion there is an alliance between Jewish and Palestinian fundamentalists, neither of whom wish to see a peace treaty. ‘We must reinforce the moderates within each camp,’ he said. ” 1 These revolutionary actions of President Sadat made peace talks possible and would lead to the landmark agreements of the Camp David Accords of 1978. In response to this visit by al-Sadat, Prime Minister Begin of Israel visited Egypt in the city of Ismailia to discuss terms for possible peace between the two nations. The outcome of these talks was passed on to the Israeli Knesset through the committees of Political Affairs and Military Affairs. The Knesset approved the plan by 64 to 8 votes, with 40 abstentions which boosted the opportunity and support for continued talks. As all this was going on however, the government of the Palestinian people, the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization), was being left out. The PLO had been established by the Arab League in 1964 as the voice of the Palestinian people, but was not recognized by all those outside of the Arab World. The PLO would be the most influential spokes-organization of the Palestinian people but was not endorsed as the, “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people”, by the Arab Summit until 1974. The PLO soon had a legitimate cause to voice their opinions about. The Six-Day War of 1967 was an Israeli invasion of Arab land, ant eh PLO was quick to take the stage. “Soon after its establishment, the PLO declared its intention of representing the Palestinian people, defending their rights, and liberating Palestine. But in 1967, as the result of another Arab-Israeli war, neighboring Arab states lost the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Syrian Golan Heights. ” 2  It is these territories which have been so heavily fought over. In the War of 1967, Israel invaded the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula, “(—areas not historically part of Eretz-Yisrael) [to establish settlements] primarily for defense and security reasons. ” 3 As a result of the Israeli occupation of these territories and the Six-Day War, the United Nations passed UNSCR 242, a document which contained the framework under which peace in the Middle East should be established, and described under what premises the territories would be returned to Arab Control. The PLO completely rejected resolution 242 and would not negotiate under its rules until the 1980s. Resolution 242 was a short resolution which called for peace in the Middle East as well as the withdrawal of Israeli troops from territories. The exact wording of this resolution, especially as it pertains to the aforementioned withdrawal from territories has led to much debate and different interpretations. “Nothing in the resolution says or implies that withdrawal is a precondition for negotiations, nor that Israel is obliged to withdraw from all the territories. The resolution says Israel has to withdraw ‘from territories’ -not even from ‘the’ territories — this to be decided in direct negotiations between the parties. ” 4 This document became the cornerstone of negotiations for the following decades. Despite its vague language, which was intentionally used to allow Israel to remain in parts of the post-1967 borders, UNSCR 242 has been used as the main source of outlining acceptable means of negotiations as well as the requirements which must be met in order to secure peace in the Middle East. However, there are many conflicting interpretations of the resolution which have contributed to the slow progress of the Israeli peace talks. The British and the United States interpret the document the same but the French have a slightly different understanding of the wording. The United Nations, however, accepts the interpretation of documents in the language in which they are submitted. This resolution was submitted in English, and thus the United States and British interpretations win out. UNSCR 242 sided heavily in favor of the Israelis. The western powers all viewed Israel as the victim in this situation and thus agreed that this conflict could be played out by Israel’s rules. “The American view, therefore, was that if the Arabs refused to sit, Israel was not obligated to move…. After all, Arab actions had brought about the 1967 War in the first place; the fact that the Arabs had lost the war was a different matter altogether. ” 5 This was not well received by the PLO and their Palestinian followers. They rejected this resolution out-right and held to their claim that the Israelis where invaders of their land. The Palestinians and other Pro-Arabs argue that UNSCR 242 requires Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza as being the occupied territories, but again here the western interpretation disagrees with the Palestinians. The other document which played a role, although less significant, in the Camp David Accords was UNSCR 338, passed on October 22, 1973. This resolution was written in response to the Yom Kippur war of 1973 where Egyptian troops crossed into Israeli occupied Sinai Peninsula on the Jewish holy day of atonement, in an effort to recapture this territory. Israel took the opportunity to not just defend itself, but to retaliate against the Arab aggressors, and so they invaded the Sinai Peninsula. The main security reason for invading the Sinai was to cut off Egypt from the Gaza Strip. After this was accomplished, Israeli forces turned north and eliminated Jordanian fortifications, thus capturing the Sinai Peninsula and gaining access to the Suez Canal. On the second day of the war, Israel invaded Syria at the Golan Heights to the northeast of Israel where they crippled all the Syrian forces and gained control of the area. Israel is still to this day present in the Golan Heights. The third region which Israel gained control over is known as the West bank and covers the area from East Jerusalem to the west bank of the Jordan River. In addition to gaining all these territories, Israel established itself as the military power of the Middle East. In just the first day of the conflict, Israel, with its superior air force, was able to destroy more than 400 Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian aircraft, most of which never had the opportunity to get off the ground. One critic of Israel’s actions during this war points out that, “After gaining the Sinai, Gaza, the Golan Heights, Judea, and Samaria, Israel called them ‘administered territories,’ which became internationally known as ‘occupied territories. ’ It should have called them Israel. ” 6 This is probably true considering that Israel was in a very strong position to make demands and have things their way having destroyed the militaries of all the surrounding nations. Whether or not any future conflicts could have been avoided by details like the wording which referred to the territories is hard to guess at, but what has happened is a long stream of diplomacy and international involvement, starting with the intervention of the United Nations. Resolution 338 basically called for three things: first, for an immediate cease fire between the two nations; second, to immediately implement UNSCR 242 and all of its parts; and third, that Israel and Egypt begin immediately negotiating terms under which a “durable peace in the Middle East” can be established. Now that there is a clear understanding of the events and documents which led up to the 1978 Camp David Accords there is but one question to be asked: Why Camp David? President Jimmy Carter found himself to have a vested interest in Middle Eastern peace for various reasons. Sadat’s willingness to talk to the Israelis was a historic event and Carter understood the political gains that could come if he helped that process succeed. Carter was also a humanitarian and wanted to show his support for human rights. All this, besides the fact that peace is generally a good thing, motivated Carter to lead Egypt and Israel into negotiations. An additional hint to President Carter’s bias toward Israel can be seen in this statement written by President Carter in response to a joint letter he received from both the leaders in March of 1979. “I have been informed that the expression ‘West Bank’ is understood by the Government of Israel to mean ‘Judea and Samaria. ’ This notation is in accordance with similar procedures established at Camp David. ” 7 Again, the reciprocal interpretation can be found on the part of the Arabs because, “Sadat also insisted on total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, according to his own interpretation of UN resolutions 242 and 338, but he had a set of priorities different from President Carter’s. ” 8 One thing was clear, no matter to what degree resolution 242 would be implemented, there would be a great struggle for everyone to agree with its meaning and consequences. With an increase in public and private support for continued peace talks, the two governments had to overcome the difficulties of setting the format for the talks. President Jimmy Carter of the United States stepped in and invited the two state figureheads to come to the United States to the presidential retreat, Camp David, and carry out these negotiations under his auspices. After much persuasion from President Carter the leaders of Egypt and Israel, President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, arrived at the Presidential resort of Camp David in Maryland, on September 5, 1978, where they would spend the next twelve days discussing under what conditions they could coexist with one another peacefully. These twelve days were very frustrating and difficult for all parties involved. On more than one occasion the Middle Eastern leaders were ready to call it quits, and would have, had it not been for the intervention and personal pleas of Carter for the negotiations to continue. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor to Prime Minister Begin and member of the Israeli delegation, was in contact with Carter before their arrival. In Brzezinski’s analysis, “Begin will define success largely in terms of procedural arrangements and will be very resistant to pressures for substantive concessions. You will have to persuade Begin to make more substantive concessions, while convincing Sadat to settle for less than an explicit Israeli commitment to full withdrawal and Palestinian autonomy. ” 9 On the first day of the talks, Prime Minister Begin made it clear to Carter that Israel’s highest priority was security, focusing on keeping settlements and airfields in the Sinai as a buffer zone between Israel and Egypt. Begin also dismissed UNSCR 242 because of its language regarding the ban on acquisition of land through war. President Carter found this conversation frustrating because it led him to believe that Begin was not wiling to be at all flexible. On the next day Carter met with Sadat for the first time to discuss Sadat’s position. Sadat presented a detailed proposal entitled, Framework for the Comprehensive Peace…. What Sadat proposed here was a very hard-line approach to dealing with Israel. Carter was again disappointed by the apparent lack of willingness to cooperate but was then shocked when Sadat procured a three page typed memo listing certain concessions which Egypt was in fact willing to accept. This was encouraging for Carter, but he was directed not to reveal this list until a later, appropriate time. Later that day Carter, Begin and Sadat all met for the first time and started the negotiations by discussing Sadat’s framework. Begin was turned off immediately by this proposal but is noted for saying that he would be willing to consider any proposal, and hoped that the Egyptians would do the same. It wasn’t until the next day, day three, that Begin officially rejected every one of Sadat’s point. This rejection led Sadat to feel confirmed that Begin wanted territory more than peace. It also didn’t help Israel that Begin, while in private talks with US Secretary of State Vance, vocalized that their major two concerns were in fact the settlements and airfields in the Sinai. Prime Minister Begin also insisted on control over the West Band, something which President Sadat knew would be unpopular with other Arab nations. “Begin’s interest in an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty was twofold. An opposition leader for thirty years, he wished to be the first Israeli leader to bring peace to the Middle East. His second and perhaps strongest desire was to secure Israel’s control of the West Bank, or what he called the regions of Judea and Samaria. Hence, he planned to trade off the Sinai for the West Bank. Begin correctly assumed that the election of Carter would help him attain his goal. He was right about the timing but wrong about Sadat and Carter’s political attitudes and views. These misperceptions resulted in long and frustrating negotiations. ”10 At this time the US delegation was encouraged to come up with an American plan because it seemed that Egypt and Israel could go no further on their own. Carter also realized at this time that a settlement may be more easily reached if he played the roll of a go-between instead of continuing the heated debates as they were. Carter began to engage in a type of micro-shuttle diplomacy in order to keep the two parties calm enough to carry out the talks. Shuttle diplomacy has its roots in the 1970’s when Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew back and forth from different capitals in the Middle East, trying to negotiate peace after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Carter was able to use this type of diplomacy very affectively by carrying messages and demands from one cabin to the next. It was through this act that Carter was able to make the largest impact, otherwise the negotiations would have been abandoned and incomplete. Over the next few days Carter transmitted messages and proposals back and forth between the delegates, but had to be very careful to remain neutral-appearing. He agreed with Sadat on the issue of the Israeli settlements in the Sinai, but he also felt that Sadat must be more flexible on the issues of security. This request did provoke the allegation from Begin that the American delegation was becoming less of a mediator and starting to take sides. This called for a break in the negotiations. On September 9th, there were no formal meetings, but the President did develop a list called the Necessary Elements of Agreement, which was used to help his delegation develop the American peace proposal. The next day continued to be leisurely as the entire party took a trip to the Gettysburg battlefield. 11 This trip is reported to have been fun for all involved. Sadat had studied the Battle at Gettysburg since he was a child and always found it a festinating subject. Begin on the other hand didn’t know anything of Gettysburg or its importance during the American Civil War. But when they party visited the spot where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address, Prime Minister Begin was able to recite it from memory. The day ended on a much harder note when the American Proposal was unveiled to the Israeli delegation. The Prime Minister was not happy that Carter was insisting on the adherence of UNSCR 242 but Carter insisted that resolution 242 must lead the way. Heated debate continued over the issue of West Bank self rule. The Israelis had wanted veto power of the West Bank government, but Carter said this looked too much like political control. Once this was pointed out, Israeli Delegate Moshe responded, “…we are not after political control. If it looks that way to you, we will look at it again. ” 12 That night President Carter stated what he saw as the main priorities: sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza would not be resolved at Camp David; the question of settlements would have to be added to any agreement; and a specific agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai would be concluded at Camp David. This meeting did not end until 3:00am but the Israelis promised a response to the American proposal by 8:00am. When the Israeli-revised proposal was given to the Egyptians, Sadat found it unacceptable in several ways, but they were all in minor details. Sadat told Carter in private that he would probably sign the accords, but there were these few details that had to be taken care of first. On September 12, Carter’s, “Framework for a Settlement in the Sinai”, was reveled. Sadat found this framework very acceptable. Begin however had continuing concerns over the UNSCR 252 language concerning the territories gained in war. This issue was still a great roadblock for the Prime Minister. On September 14 Carter ordered preparations for the failure of negotiations. Sadat said that he would sign the American draft and call it quits. A compromise was finally made that Israel would withdraw from the airfields in the Sinai if they would be replaced with American forces for a temporary transitional. Carter decided that he would accept that only if the Israelis accepted the entire American proposal, which they did.   With Sadat’s agreement for the framework on Gaza and the West Bank, Begin agreed to sign the American proposal on the Sinai. The next day, just as things seemed to be going so well, Sadat decided to leave the negotiations without any formal action at all. Carter met with Sadat alone, and reminded him of the consequences that Egypt would suffer in American relations if Sadat pulled out of negotiations like this. Eventually Sadat was convinced to stay for two more days, but then that would be it. After two more days of debate, mostly over language, an agreement was reached . This agreement, the Camp David Accords, encompassed several points: First, it was agreed that the two nations would accept UNSCR 242 and 338 in all of their parts and start to implement them immediately. Second, a concept called ‘Land for Peace’ emerged as an operating principle by which Israel would agree to give back certain occupied lands in exchange for peace in the region. Third, the accords called for a framework (which included the land for peace principal) that would lay the ground work for future negotiations between Israel and other Arab states. The land for peace process is generally accepted by all sides as the best means to work out differences, but has been able to show little progress in the 27 years since Camp David. All that has come since then has been a series of infrequent talks which are left with empty promises. The main problem with implementing the program is that Israel is not willing to give up what the Palestinians want, and the Palestinians refuse to accept only what the Israeli’s are willing to give, “…implementing the steps to negotiate such a policy into a workable program has failed to attract the interest or dedication that would be required to overcome the obstacles and to scrape away the deeply held mutual perceptions of animosity formed by conflict buildup. ” 13 The first step toward peace which took place after Camp David was the signing of the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty of 1979, for which Sadat and Begin both received the Nobel Peace Prize. Egypt received the Sinai Peninsula which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967. In exchange Egypt would officially recognize Israel’s right to exist as a nation, thus being the first Arab state to do so. This is the first also the first implementation of the ‘Land for Peace’ program. Additionally, provisions were made that Israel should address the conflicts surrounding their occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Unfortunately, in the end Israel, Egypt, and the United States all had varying interpretations on what was to happen, which resulted in nothing happening in the West Bank or Gaza for the next decade until the Madrid Conference of 1991. As part of the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai to their pre-1967 borders, Egypt gained the area’s infrastructure (roads, settlements, military bases, etc…) as well as the Sinai oil fields. Once this withdraw was complete an internationally recognized border was created so that there would be no future disputes over this land. Egypt was the strongest country of the Arab nations, yet President Sadat was not influential enough to lead the Arab world into peace with Israel in this new era. The countries of the Arab League: Libya, Syria, Iraq, South Yemen and the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization), meet in Tripoli, Libya where they agreed to condemn Sadat’s actions as high treason. “The Arab League expelled Egypt in March 26, 1979, and ‘temporarily’ moved its headquarters to Tunis…. Seven years later the league readmitted Egypt ( May 1989) after the PLO ( December 1983) and Jordan ( September 1984) had led the way in renewing relations. ” 14 From this point forward, not only was Egypt suspended by the entire Arab world but it remained on very shaky ground with much of the western world and Israel. The loosely structured United Arab Front had never been very strong but always backed on the fact that Egypt was a member of the UAF. Now that the Egyptian leader had turned his back on the other Arab states, Egypt was outcast from all future Arab relations. The results of Camp David were also not very well received throughout all of Egypt and criticisms and hatred for Sadat built until 1981 when he was assassinated. In 1980 Ronald Reagan became president of the United States and set forth his plan, the “Reagan Plan,” for peace between the Arabs and Israel. Reagan’s administration had a slightly more pro-Arab twist to it than Carter’s, but he still used the Camp David Accords as the foundation upon which to build policy. “While the Camp David accords had been ambiguous about the future of the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, the Reagan Plan envisaged their restoration to the Arabs. Nevertheless, at the same time the USA reaffirmed its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state and proposed ‘self-government in association with Jordan’”. 15 The problem was that the Arabs would still reject his policy because it included aspects of Camp David, aspects for which they had a strong distaste, and Israel would also refuse the Reagan Plan because it called for the return of the West Bank and Gaza to the Palestinians. What resulted was a stalemate between the United States and the Israeli/Arab situation. Throughout the rest of Reagan’s tenure as president virtually no progress would be made and tensions would only grow. It was not until George Bush, Sr. became president in 1988 that there was any more progress. Under this administration, James Baker, was the Secretary of State. Secretary Baker engaged in intensive shuttle diplomacy and was eventually able to persuade all nations directly involved with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to participate in a conference which would be held in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. This two-day conference included dignitaries from the USSR, the United States, Spain, Israel, the Palestinian people, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. The main Arab argument continued to be the same as at Camp David and other times of negotiations, but now Israel came under fire for their apparent unwillingness to cooperate. In reference to remarks made by Syria’s foreign minister Farouk al-Shara in Madrid, “The fact that the settlement activity persisted even after the inception of the peace process was tangible proof that Israel did not seek a genuine peace. ” 16  The talks which took place here were very intense, but only resulted in killing the land for peace concept because Israel continued to refuse giving up any land thus fortifying that peace was not yet possible. The history of the 20th Century in the Middle East is full of conflict and not much resolution, but the Camp David Accords of 1978 are undoubtedly the most influential in taking steps in the right direction. These accords set an unprecedented course of events and dialogue between Arab and Jewish people. They are criticized for having not taken full advantage of the situation, but without the successful completion of these accords, the Middle East would surly be a less stable place today.

    "title": "Sponsored Identity - Cultural Policy in Puerto Rico",
    "body": "2005/02/07 - Sponsored Identity: Cultural Policy in Puerto Rico, by Arlene Davilla, explores the current and historical context of Puerto Rico’s cultural identity, mostly as expressed through events and festivals.   The author explores the governments concern of the expanding presence of corporate sponsors and how they are affecting the traditional aspects of the nation and what problems this poses for some people.   The author lays out a significant and interesting combination of facts which revolve around how this influence is being regulated to stay within reasonable guidelines, and how it is affecting the festive scene of the nation. Much of the political culture of Puerto Rico has changed over the last half century.   In 1952 there was large support for independence from the United States.   In the 1993 plebiscite elections, the two dominate parties (who support a continued political relationship between the island and the US) received a sum of 95% of the vote, while only 4. 4% went to the party in favor of independence.   The author argues however, that despite these voting statistics, Puerto Rico still has a very strong nationalist identity and that this is only an indication of a change in, “historical manifestation”. Part of this nationalist identity which was preserved in the 1993 elections is that the unique Puerto Rican culture was affirmed to be strong and uninfluenced despite its United States statehood.   A part of this was a dedication to maintaining Spanish as the official language of the island and continuing an independent team in the Olympic Games. The prevailing party in the 1993 election was the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).   Their platform argued that Puerto Rico was best off maintaining its commonwealth status under the United States because its offered the, “best of both worlds,” by guaranteeing security of the national culture while offering American citizenship at the same time. The PPD’s opposition which lost by only 2. 2% argued that statehood status of joining the Union would allow for the preservation of culture (i. e. : the national hymn, flag, language, etc…) while providing the economic boost which would allow for a better quality of life. The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) is the governmental agency in charge of developing and maintaining cultural programs and events, as well as promoting official Puerto Rican cultural policy.   Such an office as this is obviously set up to provide a healthy outlet and venue for the people to express themselves, but often has been an agency of cultural struggle where inequalities have been manifested. Much of this conflict is nested in the fact that despite its small size, Puerto Rico is a very diverse nation with vivid folklore culture as well as modern sentiment.   The objective of the ICP is to find the suitable middle ground on which to promote Puerto Rico while implementing cultural policy which can be universally accepted. The ICP is criticized for operating on a top-down mode of policy creation where the major attractions get all of the institute’s attention and resources, while smaller, local traditions and key places are left along the wayside struggling to be noticed.   An example of this is on the east coast where African-Caribbean culture is predominant in the whole region, but only officially recognized by the ICP in the city of Loiza where a carnival-like patron-saint festival draws many tourists every year. The ICP office in the city of Caone is located in the middle of the predominant and historical town square.   Although this place is of significant historical importance, its roll as the city center is no longer recognized by the towns citizens.   Only the administrative core is still located here in the historic town hall and other important buildings of administration.   The town’s people have been redirected by suburban shopping centers and a suburban way of life that that this historic core is no longer seen as an important symbol of the town’s heritage. One major concern of the ICP in their day-to-day operations is to not appear too commercial.   For instance, in the city of Caone, the use of loudspeakers and billboards is a popular and efficient way to advertise one’s services.   But these methods have never been used because of the institute’s fear that is would make them look too commercial.   Instead, the institute employs local sponsors as an alternative to mainstream forms of advertising and community support. Festivals are extremely predominant forms of cultural expression in Puerto Rico.   There is some concern that many festivals nowadays are commercial expressions of political motives that are obscured behind a festival format.   The conflict that the ICP has is that they only promote traditional and ethnic cultural events which portray a ‘higher class’ of cultural understanding.   Their events are attended by much fewer people than the mainstream festivals which promote aspects of modern pop-culture.   These mainstream festivals are seen as being much less culturally significant by politicians, intellectuals, and the public at large, however, they do pull many more people to the event because of their commercialization. Many of these festivals are seen as events portraying competing views on what Puerto Rico’s cultural definition is, and what the government wants it to be, or be interpreted as.   These same governmental figures lack control over the festival activities because of the, “ambiguity of the island’s political status. ”  This political ambiguity translates into the culture as having an equal ambiguity over finding what the national identity (culturally speaking) is. Despite this behind the scenes struggle for the cultural hierarchy, the nation’s citizenship for the most part has a uncaring attitude about how cultural or not a festival is.   For many Puerto Ricans, festivals are the only forms of entertainment they have, so it doesn’t matter what type of music, food, or crafts are around, it’s all a form of entertainment, the genre doesn’t matter so much. Earlier, corporate sponsorship in cultural matters was discussed.   To expand on that discussion it should be noted that the number of corporate sponsors in increasing on the island at that this does conflict with the current Puerto Rican cultural policy (although it is not illegal).   The ICP would argue that these entities take away from the cultural aspects of the events they sponsor, but the author of this book disagrees and states that they are, “added players elaborating conceptions of Puerto Ricanness. ” Puerto Rico consumes over $12. 2 billion annually in American-made goods.   As a result, there are huge advertising campaigns on the Island by American companies.   In many regards it is close to the same as in the United States.   Puerto Ricans are surrounded by corporate logos, posters, advertisements, commercials, products, etc…  As a result, this corporate sponsorship is hardly a sight out of the ordinary for most people and its effectiveness has been watered down. The author also argues that if the people of the island are driving the markets in such a way that make corporate sponsorship so worthwhile, then obviously that is a part of the Puerto Rican culture.   By making the publicity industry so predominant, the corporate involvement in festivals is far less of a contradiction so much as it is a component of the modern culture.   As it stands, corporate sponsors are selling products through the cultural medium, and are conveying the people’s own culture in the products which the people buy. The commercial involvement in the nation’s culture and image is seen in such a negative light by the political officials in part because of fear that the big-money corporations are in competition to represent the people’s culture through their products and not just the events they promote.   One reason this is so threatening is that culture is seen through official eyes as a promotion of traditional activities, and corporations (many of which are American) are not a part of the nation’s history and tradition.   Their recent arrival and rapidly-growing predominance is shredding what is seen as traditional by packaging it in a non-traditional fashion.   However, corporate sponsorship is a means of convenience because they do bring big money to the area for the promotion of cultural events, festivals, and their own products (of course).   The fear of the politicians is that corporations are threatening the,” domain of sovereignty. ” There are some exceptions to this such as the Bacardi Folk Arts Fair where Bacardi sponsors this ICP-sanctioned festival but stays within the guidelines set out by the ICP so that it is still considered a true cultural event.   This hybrid of culture and sponsorship is one example of how corporations can be helpful in promoting traditional values and events as well as the modern ones. Despite the political conflict surrounding the definition of culture in Puerto Rico, the power to define that is not in any one person’s hands.   Culture is a broad concept which encompasses everybody.   Corporate sponsors and mainstream festivals are just as much a part of the culture as the traditional folklore; even the mere presence of a conflict between the two in the form of this debate is a part of the culture.   Culture is all that exists and is supported by the people of a nation.   One can not say that a festival with a huge turn out of attendance is not a part of a national culture just because it hasn’t been that way in the past.   The logic in that argument is not valid.   Culture is the sum of all aspects of all types of events in Puerto Rico, and so long as this debate lives on, it will be a part of the culture, too.

The author shares that the modern state has its birth in European history, stretching back to the Holy Roman Empire 1600 years ago.   The author continuously refers to the idea that the history of the modern state is the history of Europe.   Early in Europe Feudalism was the major form of government.   This form of government is structured by loose agreements and obligations which flow down to an autonomous level.   Feudalism was the most popular form of government from the 8th to 14th centuries when Absolutist states, followed by the nation-state dominated.   From the nation-state comes the modern state.   There are four types of modern stats, they are: constitutionalism, the liberal state, representative democracy, and the single-arty polity.   So why did the nation-state become so dominate?  There is no single event or set of phenomena which occurred to answer this, rather it is sheer luck that this form would be spread through military victories from nations which happened to be ruled by this form.   As the early nation-states spread, so did their form of government. Continuing on this same trend, the creation of colonies and the spread of globalization spread the concept of the nation-state. "

    "title": "Otto von Bismarck and His Path to Unification",
    "body": "2004/05/05 -  During the 19th Century, Europe underwent many dynamic changes such as many wars, governmental upheavals and cultural refinements; therefore, no one thing could stand alone as the main event of the European 19th Century.   However, if one were to take the largest geographic area in central Europe contained by a single empire, one would find Prussia and Austria.   Therefore, the unification of Germany could reasonably be considered the most dynamic change in central Europe during the 19th century, with the possible exception of the 1848 revolutionsy.   With little doubt, Otto von Bismarck was the most influential leader of Prussia during this time frame.   His authoritative leadership  aidedleadership aided in the creation of a unifiedunification of Germany.   Bismarck’s legacy was to see the German people united and he was very careful and patient in planning the road map to this unification.   In part, Bismarck succeeded in this with two major phases now known as the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. Bismarck – A brief history. Otto von Bismarck inherited both aristocratic and common legacies at birth.   On his father’s side, he belonged to a noble family that owned estates in the Altmark of Germany.   His mother’s only claim to fame, however, was that her father had been a cabinet secretary for Fredrick the Great.   When Otto Bismarck was very young, his family leased out their estates and moved to Berlin where BismarckOtto was enrolled in a boarding school. He eventually moved through the echelons to the uUniversities in Berlin and Göttingen.   As a result of his formal education, Bismarck hadHis  acquired a great interest within him ofin history and literature, which he studied and read intensely. At the end of his time in school, Bismarck passed the state examination and was rejected from the Prussian Foreign Service, but was accepted into the judiciary.   “The judiciary in the common-law conception is one of the high organs of the state, co-ordinate with the legislature and the executive. ”   After being accepted iInto the judiciary (Add more info on this) he attempted twice to begin a civil service career but failed. These failures shaped his future distaste for  bureaucrats.   With his hopes for a career in civil service crushed, Otto Bismarck returned to south Germany where he managed the family estates for the majority of the next ten years. During the ten-year stretch when he was managing his estates, Bismarck Otto built up his interest in political thought and theory and questioned how the Prussian government might better be arranged.   BismarckOtto concluded that it was a pity that Prussia lacked a Parliament both because he felt it to be  a necessary part of a government where opposing forces could be voiced on issues, and because he felt that in a parliament he could have an opportunity to make a name for himself. Bismarck’s opportunity to act on his ambitions came in 1847 when a United Diet was summoned by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV to debate a new tax.   Having answered to the summons, Bismarck played his cards right as an avid supporter of the King.   Among the few people who shared the king’s conservative views, Bismarck was certainly the best versed, which brought to him the attention of the King and other major players in national politics. From 1848 to 1859, there were a series of German revolts during which Bismarck defended the King’s policies and desires during parliamentary debates and remained one of the few capable speakers on the King’s side.   The German people were becoming contemptuous of their leaders and pressure was rising for a change in government.   The radical liberals were threatening a force of this change through revolution which Bismarck understood as a real threat to which he must heed.   To avoid revolution, Bismarck lobbied for a parliament in which policy could be made, and lesser people could have a voice in national politics.   “This frightened traditional aristocrats, and was the impetus for a modernizing movement, which Bismarck embraced, of establishing parliaments which allowed for at least the sense of ‘participatory democracy’ by the masses, and served as a safety valve to diffuse revolutionary forces.   Bismarck was pacifying the masses. ”  Although the eventual outcome would indeed be a reorganization of political structure, the effectiveness of such a parliament would be nullified by the provisions under which it must operate. By granting the liberals a few of their requests (such as a parliament), Bismarck minimized the revolution’s effect by creating a government with a parliament, but one which was so restricted that it was as if it did not exist at all. Even had the parliament not been so weak, the effect would have been nearly the same because the limited membership would have allowed betterment of only the upper classes.   “So Germany obtained neither unity nor constitutional government. The only tangible result of the revolution was the constitution issued by the King of Prussia in 1850. This remarkable document left the executive power in the hands of the King; it established a parliament of two houses, the lower to be elected by manhood suffrage—but it reduced that suffrage to a joke by dividing the voters into three classes, according to the amount of taxes paid”.   As a result, “Bismarck was duly rewarded for the role he had played as one of the leading younger men of the conservative faction in the stormy years from 1848 to 1850.   In 1851 he was appointed Prussian envoy to the diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt. It was a key post in the making of Prussian policy, especially in relation to the future shape of Germany. ”  Bismarck uses this position to springboard his plans for German unification.  The Prussian envoy to the Diet of the German Confederation which was the highest position within the Prussian Foreign Service, and Bismarck was able to accomplish mighty things with the power he inherited from this title.   During his time with the Foreign Service, Bismarck filled several ambassador positions, to Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Paris.   In 1862 he became the Prussian minister-president.   In this position, Bismarck was vested with the power to  where he rarun the country in the name of the king, and began to earn the title, “The Iron Fisted Chancellor,” as he ran the country like a dictator in insubordination? of parliament, often times over-riding the King’s interests.   and iIt is from this position that he was able to oversee the unification of Germany. 1 Austro Prussian War (Intro): Prior to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, most of Central Europe was ruled under by the German Confederation, which included many states, the largest of which being Austria and Prussia.   The cause of the war had its beginnings in a dispute over a section of land annexed from the Danes called the Schleswig-Holstein.   This land was to be jointly ruled by Austria and Prussia according to the Gastein Treaty of 1865,.   However but, Bismarck, saw this as an opportunity wanting to create a reason to exclude Austria from having future influence over German relations, usedand he used this situation to spark war between the two states by accusing Austria of violating the treaty. Causes: The Gastein Treaty was an unstable document which would not be able to stand the test of time; “it was only a temporary expedient to put off the conflict which henceforward was inevitable-inevitable, that is, if the Emperor of Austria still refused to sell Holstein to Prussia”. 2   With this situation, Bismarck had the stage set to act out phaseact one of his plans to unify the German people.   This first phase was to remove Austria from all German affairs.   Bismarck understood that he needed the popular support of the general public, and to invade Austria would diminish his popularity.   The ideal situation would be that for Austria Austria to invade Prussia, and the Schleswig-Holstein situation was the perfect platform to use to manipulate the Austrian government into this trap. In preparation for this war, Bismarck only feared France’s influence.   France was one of the leading super powers in Europe. If France sided with Austria over this issue then Prussia would be squeezed out between the countries.   To assure that France would stay neutral, Bismarck made several trips to France to win the approval of the French leader, Napoleon III.   “He saw Napoleon again in his return through Paris; the two succeeded in coming to an understanding.   Napoleon assured him that he might depend on the absolute neutrality on France, in case of war withbetween Prussia and Austria” 2(241).   Having his assurances from France and the strings of war ready to be pulled, Bismarckhe turned up the heat by sending anonymous dispatches to Austrian media that hinted at a possible Austrian invasion in violation of the Gastein Treaty in order to provoke a building of the Austrian militia which would in turn be seen as an act of preparation for war. The rumors that these dispatches caused sparked nervous behavior among the Austrian princes who reacted by mobilizing army troops to the Prussian-Austrian border merely as a defense mechanism.   In Prussia, this move was seen by the public (as distorted by the media) as an act to serve as the pretext of war.   Having achieved exactly the result he wanted, Bismarckhe knew it was just a matter of time before the tension would snap and Austria would strike.   In the meantime, many tried to preserve keep the peace; “? except himself, there was in fact scarcely a single man who desired the war; the King still seized every opportunity of preserving the peace. ” 2(2491) At last, after a long wait, Austria made the final provocation, as Bismarck knew they would.   “[Austria] proposed to summon the Estates of Holstein, and at the same time brought the question of the Duchies before the Diet.   Bismarck declared that this was a breach of the treaty of Gastein, and that the agreement was therefore void.  ; Prussian troops were ordered to enter Holstein. ” 2(258)”. 1 With this declaration the Austro-Prussian War began, and seven weeks later would end with Austria left in shambles and cast out of the German Confederation. War only lasted seven weeks in which the Prussian army trampled all opposition they encountered.   Bismarck’s was very particular in the way in which the war was conducted and was cautious not to ‘over do it. ’. “Bismarck had no intention of weakening Austria, a potential ally, more than necessary. ” Other than pure victory, tThis war signified the ended of Austrian influence domination over German affairs and rallied German-wide patriotism for the German cause.   With his public support higher than ever, Bismarck took supreme control over anything to do with the German people and prepared to organize the final stages from which to implement his goal of a united German nation-state. Now, having rallied the German people, Prussia, under Bismarck, could unify the German people under the rule of one country: Germany. Prussia was enlarged substantially in several places after conquering the Schleswig-Holstein by obtaining ports on both the North and Baltic Seas.   Additionally, the states of Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassou, and Frankfurt joined as Prussian States, greatly enlarging the North West frontier.   This together made Prussia equal to 2/3 of the land thatwhich contained German population. “Replacing the old system of government as it had been run under the German Confederation was Bismarck’s chief concern: “On July 1, 1867, the North German Confederation came legally into being. It consisted of: Prussia, Saxony, the grand duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, and Saxe-Weimar, the duchies of Brunswick, Anhalt, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the free cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck, with smaller duchies and principalities— twenty-two in all. The princes retained certain sovereign rights: they might still summon local Estates, levy local taxes, and be separately represented at foreign courts; but the whole conduct of foreign affairs, the raising and control of the army, the decision of peace and war were to rest with the president. The executive was vested in the King of Prussia as hereditary president, assisted by a federal chancellor. The Legislature was to consist of (i) a Bundesrat, or federal council, composed of plenipotentiaries from the confederate states, and (ii) a Reichstag, elected by universal manhood suffrage. Military service was to be compulsory throughout the Confederation.   The first official act of the president was the appointment of Bismarck as chancellor of the Confederation. ” In drafting the constitution for the new confederation, Bismarck’s main concern was that of political control and who would have it.   His constitution did three main things: first, it conserved the Prussian aristocratic-monarchical system; second, it united the idea of German nationalism and particularism while solving the problem of uniting sates of unequal size; and thirdly, it attracted Germans of the southern states as well as their individual federal governments.   The North German Confederation consisted of Prussia, plus 21 smaller states.   A Bundesrat (national Parliament) was established with 43 delegates from the 22 states, which was elected by universal male suffrage.   The King of Prussia would serve as the president of the confederation.   “Within a year, the constitution of the North German Confederation came into effect, laying the groundwork for the final unification of Germany four years later. ”   With this, Bismarck had unified all the German states (minus Austria), and created the appearance of a federation of independent and equal states. The liberals felt that they had accomplished their goal of obtaining a more democratic government, but what really existed now, although seemingly democratic, was in fact a dysfunctional government in which the noble elite still exercised all the power   It was the general structure which was liberal in this new government, “The federal government consisted of an executive, in the persons of the Emperor and his Chancellor and their staffs, a Federal Council (Bundesrat), composed of delegations from the separate states, and a National Parliament (Reichstag), which was elected by universal manhood suffrage and secret ballot. ” The Bundesrat, similar to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, was a democratic legislative body in that no law could be passed by the king or anyone else without its approval.   However, the King of Prussia appointed 17 of the 43 members of the Bundesrat without having to seek approval from anyone; thus, of course, the king could accomplish anything he desired. The King was also in total and indisputable control of the armies as well as the only decision maker in foreign policy.   Instead of establishing an independent federal government modeled upon that of the United States, Bismarck improvised, combining a national lower house elected by universal suffrage with a second chamber not unlike that of the United States Congress and with the Prussian king as emperor. There was to be at first no federal administration, because the princes jealously guarded the administrative prerogatives of their states. This was the origin of the Bundesrat which gave the states a semblance of authority over the decision-making of the federation and was mainly used as the instrument of Prussian hegemony over the rest of Germany. Where as the federal Bundesrat was effective in policy and decision making, the Reichstag was not.   Democracy failed here in that only the upper house had real power and the states had none.   “While the democratic suffrage was achieved for the North German Confederation, democratic government was not, for the powers of the Reichstag were carefully limited. The veto right of the Bundesrat protected Prussia and the other state governments against Reichstag interference in their internal affairs and against the passage of laws that were contrary to vital conservative and particularistic interests”.   In this way the nobility was able to give the appearance of a democratic government without relinquishing control or sovereignty of ‘their’ confederation. With this false-democracy in place, the northern German states unified, and Austria excluded, Bismarck only had one thing left to accomplish: unify the southern states, most notably the states of Bavaria and Wurttemberg, with the northern states.   South Germany did not initially join the North German Confederation because they had been united with Austria during the Austro-Prussian War.   Unlike with Austria, Bismarck did not want these states excluded from his empire.   To get the southern states to join him, Bismarck once again embarked on a mission to force them to choose one of two evils, hoping that he would be seen as the lesser evil. The southern states were very reluctant to join the North German Confederation for several reasons, but mostly because they saw it for the regional hegemon which it was, and did not want to loose sovereignty over their own state affairs.   Bismarck felt that the only way to get the southern states to join with him was to find a way for those states to need the confederation.   Bismarck saw an opportunity to make himself seem like a savior while expanding his empire.   To do this,Bismarck would provoke France to invade the southern German states and then offer the weak south military assistance in exchange for their membership to the confederation. Since the Austro-Prussian war in 1866 there had already existed tension between the French and the Germans.   Even though France had been neutral on the battle field, they were in strong opposition of the southern German states uniting with the northern confederation.   This being, in part, due to their jealousy of the German people having control over the Main River, a region which France had long wished to dominate.   “France was in the wrong, in the first place, in so far as she had since 1866 attempted to block the unification of Germany. In taking her stand on ‘the line of the Main’ and opposing the union of the South German states with the North German Confederation, she had been denying to the German people the right to settle their own affairs, in a way which, in spite of all extenuating circumstances, cannot be justified. ”  The French had growing concerns about their growing neighbor and started to see France’s own prosperity threatened in the event that Germany decide add France to it’s empire. The final draw was made when the Spanish throne was offered to a member of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, one of the key members to the ruling house of Prussia.   The offer for the throne was accepted on the advice of Bismarck but after hefty protests of the French was revoked.   “But the aggressive French foreign minister, the duc de Gramont, insisted on further Prussian assurances, which King William I of Prussia (later Emperor William I) refused. Bismarck, by publishing the famous Ems dispatch, inflamed French feeling, and on July 19, France declared war. ”  The Ems dispatch was a letter from King William of Prussia, to Bismarck, regarding the French request to guarantee that Prussia would never pursue the Spanish Throne.   King William had denied this request which subsequently agitated the French, but Bismarck edited the King’s report of the occasion in such a way that it was sure to cause war: “By this suddenly devised expedient, Bismarck intended, obviously, to prevent further negotiations, to provoke France to a declaration of war, to insure the neutrality of the foreign powers and the sympathy of foreign opinion, and finally to arouse German national sentiment. Whatever may be thought of its morality, and Bismarck’s own revelations later as to its origins played into the hands of Germany’s enemies, the Ems Dispatch served these purposes to perfection, although it was the excuse, rather than the cause, of France’s virtual declaration of war (July 15), as the author has shown elsewhere”. Once France declared war on Prussia, it was apparent that they would attack the southern, un-unified German states first as a matter of relativity to geography.   Those states, aware of the danger they were in, sought help from the unified northern states.   The north answered to the prayers of the south and for their protection the southern states unified the north.   “Partly because they believed France the aggressor, the states of S Germany enthusiastically joined the North German Confederation-just as Bismarck had hoped”.   Once war was declared and the southern states had joined the confederation, Prussian troops did not hesitate one moment to respond.   Without waiting for a French invasion, Prussia took the war to France.   This war lasted less than a month and ended with the capture of the French emperor and 100,000 of his men. The war concluded in two phases which passed in the form on treaties.   The first treaty was the Preliminary Treaty of Versailles, and the final treaty was the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871).   The Treaty of Versailles was merely a draft which stated most of the details of the eventual Treaty of Frankfurt, but was most significant because it halted troop movement.   The Treaty of Frankfurt, signed in May of 1871, was the formal ending to the Franco-Prussian War.   This treaty, for the most part, ratified the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles signed earlier, which included territory to be ceded to Germany, 5 billion francs be paid to Germany, and that Prussian troops would stay in France until the payment was made in full.   The troops were withdrawn quickly in 1873 due to speedy payment by the French.   As a result of these two treaties, the German Empire was finally proclaimed, which replaced the North German Confederation, King William I was declared as the Emperor of Germany and Germany was recognized as a satiated nation-state.   This declaration also signified the beginning of the Second German Reich, of which Bismarck was made the chancellor. The doctrine under which the German Empire was ruled was the Imperial Constitution of 1871.   This constitution continued to build German nationalism by keeping a week lower house of government, allowing only the highest officials to control government functions.   Bismarck held out in protecting the interests of the nobility and the national higher Archie by creating the false appearance of a liberal government, but what he did in turn was dig a hole for the future of Germany.   The structures Bismarck put into place in creating the second Reich had built-in flaws that allowed unchecked growth in German nationalism that led to the First World War.   Germany’s defeat, subsequent humiliation, and continued weak legislative institutions allowed for a revival of nationalism under Hitler that led to the establishment of the third Reich, with disastrous consequences for Germany and the world. By giving the radical liberals a taste of democracy he preserved his union and through his military genius and political strategy Bismarck expanded the German Empire.   Eventually, however, this false democracy would fall, and what so many men died for, would be lost.   One thing however is for sure:  Bismarck and his actions have had long standing affects on the German nation-state which are still apparent today.   Bismarck formed an empire, unified a common-people, and laid the ground work for the creation of the Central European hegemon of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

    "body": "2004/04/28 - Photo Credit: Larry Vienneau  If you have any questions about this paper or the Raven in Native American Mythology, feel free to leave a comment below or message me directly at @judsonlmoore. The Raven in Native American Mythology: Native American culture is embedded with extensive tales and legends.   Every aspect of life, death, and existence has its own story to explain why things are the way they are.   Often, different Native American tribes had very similar beliefs, but most tribes have their own unique variations in the details of these legends.  The raven is a very important figure in most Native American cultures.   It is seen as the creator of light and as a trickster figure.   As the maker of light, the raven symbolizes the ultimate creator of all things of that which existed before the beginning.   As a trickster figure, the raven is seen as a catalyst of mischief and mayhem. Although credited as the “creator” of life, one story of Raven depicts a greedy and mischievous figure who mostly works for selfish reasons while at the same time teaching lessons about life.   The Native American tribes recognized that Raven was the key which opened many of life’s treasures to them and for this they were grateful. They also realized that Raven did not do this for the good of man or anything else but only for himself.   So although Native Americans are thankful for what Raven has given to them, they realize that Raven is not to be trusted and that he is more selfish than generous (Burke). Check out my #WhileYoung advice series for living a full and prosperous life! Because of the numerous tribes that believed in the raven, there were numerous variations of beliefs surrounding the story of the raven.   The following is a summary of the creation myth of the Tlingit tribe from the North Pacific coast region: The name of Raven is Kit-ka’ositiyi-qa-yit (“Son of Kit-ka’ositiyiqa).   Raven was instructed from birth by his father in every subject so that the raven could make a world; after trying many different ways, the raven was finally successful.   The raven started out by creating light.   Raven had heard that there was a very rich man living atop a hill who had light but did not let it out for the world to see.   Raven tried many ways to get into the house so that he could obtain the light and finally devised a plan that would work.   Raven transformed himself into a speck of dirt and placed himself in a glass of water from which the man’s daughter was drinking.   The girl drank the speck of dirt and in this way became pregnant. Some time later a child was born and this child was possessed by Raven.   When Raven had the strength to crawl around the house he found the shelf where the man had his treasures on display.   Raven cried intensely for the objects on the shelf and eventually the man pulled down his bag of stars and allowed the child to play with it.   Raven rolled the stars around on the ground for awhile and then, when he was given the opportunity, allowed them to go up the smoke hole where they scattered into the sky in the arrangement which you now see them in today. The next day the boy cried for more of the things on the shelf and was given a bag which contained the moon.   Raven played with the moon and in the same fashion as the stars he let the moon up the smoke hole and it went into the sky for all to see.   On the third day the boy cried very intensely for the final object on the shelf and the man, knowing what would happen, but unable to refuse his grandson, gave him the box that contained the sun.   As soon as Raven had this he flew up the smoke hole with the box having stolen all the man’s valuables.   Raven did not yet release the sun. Raven shortly thereafter was told of a well with a never-ending supply of water.   Raven went to the place where the well was and learned that the man who owned the well kept it covered and never left its side. He even built his house around the well and slept by it so that no one else could drink from it.   Once again Raven began to scheme a plan to get this water. (https://www. judsonlmoore. com/book/) Raven disguised himself as the man’s brother-in-law and went to the man telling him they he would stay the night with him.   Both went to sleep and in the early morning Raven woke up and went away from the well.   When Raven returned he brought with him dog dung and put it on the sleeping man’s buttocks.   Raven awoke the man and showed the man the accident he had had in the night.   The man embarrassed and in need to clean up, ran out of the house to clean up. By the time the man came back, Raven had drunk up nearly all the water.   Raven flew out the smoke hole away from the man but got stuck.   The man commenced with making a fire under Raven to make smoke and this smoke turned the raven the color we are accustomed to seeing it today (before that, Raven was pure white).   Raven finally escaped and flew out over the land spitting water here and there creating the great rivers of the world.   Whenever small drops of water leaked from his beak they created the small creeks. When Raven happened upon a village where any beings lived, he was asked if he came from the house where the sun was kept.   Raven pulled out the box and opened it just enough to let a bit of light out as he was proud of his accomplishment.   The people were thrown back by this bright light and then began to fight with Raven to get the box. Raven was unnerved by this so he opened the box all the way and the sun shot up into the sky.   The beings of this village were then transformed into the animals whose skin they were wearing and ran off into the forest and into the oceans.   In this manner the sun was brought into the world and the forests and oceans were populated with  game. Raven is credited for many other gifts and curses to man but the “creation” of the stars, moon, rivers, and sun are the most essential and universally believed myths amongst North American Indians (Hooker). This version of the creation myth is one of many ways that the story has been told.   All Native American stories have been passed down for generations orally, none of the stories have been written until the last 100 years (or so).   Because of this, there are many similar versions of the story.   For example, one other popular version told in the Northwest Coast region states that the daughter of the keeper of the sun and moon was impregnated by Raven, not because he turned himself into a speck of dust and fell in her water, but because he turned himself into, “…a spruce needle and floated into her basket of water.   When she drank from it, he impregnated her with himself” (McNeil).   Here the same basic concept and the overall effect is the same, but the meaning is slightly different. Start living your “what if” #WhileYoung to live a life of happiness and fulfillment!  There are also discrepancies about the physical appearance of the raven baby between tribes of the same Northwest region: one indicates the baby to be, “immaculate in every way” (McNeil), whereas another refers to the child as, “oddly shaped in every way with deformities such that make it hard to believe that this child was of human birth. ” One example given by the Tsimshian tribe of British Columbia, shows Raven as a pure savior of man in providing light to the human world.   According to their belief, Raven was sorry for the humans who were forced to stumble around in the dark, and knowing that there was light in heaven, Raven, out of the goodness of his heart, stole the light from the heavens and brought it to earth so that it could be enjoyed by everyone (The Spirit World 26). The Tlingit legend has its roots in that Raven stole the sun and stars from a rich man.   Many other Native American cultures have very similar variations of this, particularly different only in the character which performed the act, sometimes the Rabbit.   But in the Slavery Tribe legend the stories do not compare at all.   In this legend it is Coyote and Eagle who merely steal the boxes of moon and sun from human hunters who dwell in the woods (Erdoes 140-142). According to Cherokee legend, the raven was also not in the least bit associated with the sun.   In the Cherokee tale, the sun is Rabbit with his tail on fire and he is running around and around the world trying to put the fire out, thus creating the sun rise and sun set (Hannah). The belief in the raven as the creator of light and as a trickster figure can be found throughout many Indian civilizations but is most prominent in Northwest America among tribes who are classified as the Northwest Coast Indians (Keepers of the Totem 21). The raven is significant especially in of North America.   In Northeast America, Raven is an important figure as the creator of light, but not so much as a trickster figure; the Coyote fulfills that distinguished position in many tribes east of the Great Plains. The raven, as the creator of light, is given credit for the gifts of the sky (and its contents), water, and many animal populations to humankind.   According to Native American legend, the raven is indeed the means by which the stars, moon, sky, and rivers were exposed to the world.   Raven’s dual roll in folklore seems to be creation and mischief. Although mischievous in nature, humans don’t take a sinister view from Raven’s actions, but find more positive ways to learn about life from Raven.   For instance, one account of the creation myth indicates that, “Raven was white before he stole the sun…. His trip through the smoke hole transformed him into the black creature, as he is today.   He paid a price for his audacity” (McNeil).   This passage goes on to say that the moral from this story is that, “the price we pay has more to do with how we respond to a situation in life than the price itself” (McNeil). As time has had its toll on the Native American mythology, a new perspective is being derived about the raven.   Traditionally, Raven legends have only been told by elite tribesmen because only they had the time to learn the stories. Thus the stories have tended to be oriented more around the elite.   However a more modern view shows that the Tlingit Tribe believes that Raven thought of the poor in the same manner which Jesus did, regarding them sympathetically (Bierhorst 25). It is never too late, but starting #WhileYoung is a great opportunity! Find out more now! “Raven is not only a powerful supernatural character, but also a trickster” (Erdoes 344).   Although the Raven is credited for giving such gifts to mankind, it is still said that his heart may not have been in exactly the right place in those acts.   Raven, by nature, is very greedy and constantly seeking food (Burke).  As one reads through the myths of Raven it becomes apparent that Raven is performing all these acts not out of generosity, but out of vanity.   It is true that he delivered the stars, sun, moon, and rivers to man, but his motivations were selfish, and his means are never pure.   Raven simply contrives ways to steal other’s treasures and create a better world for himself; the fact that all of the world and mankind benefit from this is simply a by-product of Raven’s own selfish desires. The ways in which Raven goes about obtaining these ‘gifts’ are always mischievous in nature and always cause harm or loss to others.   Yet despite this, man is still thankful for the end result of Raven’s actions so long as Raven does not directly come into contact with man, for it is when Raven and man meet that man quickly changes his mind about his thankfulness to Raven.   Regardless of what symbol is used, the trickster figure reflects the values of the given tribe and explains their understanding of human nature (Leeming 48).   Whatever the circumstances surrounding Raven led events may be, the “trickster figure is always a character of change” (Hannah). Some say that people project their own characteristics onto their deities.   If that is so, the Native Americans were self-aware regarding creativity, generosity, cleverness, larceny and mischief.   With these qualities that they recognized among themselves, they endowed the Raven. As with many deities, the raven is regarded with respect and wariness.   Being in close intercourse with the Raven would be like having “too much religion. ”  Appreciating the raven from afar through storytelling was safer and more functional than being in close contact with such unpredictable a character.

    "title": "Book Review - The Unification of Germany",
    "body": "2004/03/08 - The Unification of Germany, by Michael Gorman, is a short yet precise and detailed book which outlines the events surrounding and influencing the German Unification of 1870-71.   This book tells the history of Germany during the 19th century, focusing on details which help the reader understand the causes for revolution in 1848, the conflict between central European states, and the eventual unification of Germany as a nation-state.   To powerfully illustrate the changes and the preventions during this time, this book is packed full of translated primary sources, political cartoons, charts and graphs, and commentary from the author. To help the reader understand the purpose of the book, the author includes a chapter by chapter synopsis of the book in the introduction.   Covering all of the key elements of the book, the author makes an effective effort to summarize German Unification.   As one reads throughout the rest of the book, the introduction serves as a sort of stabilizer by helping the reader keep in mind why this event in history is important.   Gorman does such a good job of gathering information and commenting on the singular importance of each piece, but sometimes fails to tie it all together.   The introduction lashes all the bits and pieces into one coherent chapter. As I previously stated, many of these bits and pieces consist of primary sources which have been translated.   Many major treaties like the, Treaty Establishing the Zollverein, even constitutions, like the Act of German Confederation, and extracts from personal letters like that of the, Letters from Metternich, all provide the reader with a real sense of the circumstances in 19th century Germany.   Before each piece there is a brief introduction to what is about to be read.   Sometimes there are several pages of text which tell the story of the event at hand, other times just a paragraph.   Either way the author provides enough information for the reader to both remain interested and understand what is being read as it applies to German unification.   After each translation there is a set of questions which one should either be able to answer after having read the piece or be able to better understand the significance of the piece by keeping that question in mind on a second reading. Maps and charts are also heavily used in this book.   Most of the maps and charts concentrate on three fields: economics, politics, and state boundaries.   The use of maps are very helpful for seeing the geography of mineral resources and industry which affect the economics of central Europe which help make clear why some places were fought over and desired to be included in the new German state, while other places were left out.   Maps are also used to show the location of different dialects as well as treaty boundaries and trade zones very effectively.   Graphs are used for comparison of industrial production between years more than anything else, but there are a few that indicate political preferences via voting comparison in different governmental bodies. Finally, the use of political cartoons depicts some aspects of European culture during the era.   One can get a sense of humor as well as high tensions with the selection of cartoons which I found to be extremely helpful in discovering the tone in which this book should be read. In Conclusion, Michael Gorman’s, The Unification of Germany, gets two thumbs up for being detailed but not long winded, for having extensive primary resources, the clear presentation of charts and maps, and for packing all this information into fewer than 110 pages.   This book should be high on anyone’s list who is interested in the unification of Germany or seeking information about Germany in the 19th century.

    "title": "Meeting Papa Roach On Tour In Hamburg Germany",
    "body": "2000/10/14 - The Journey To Papa Roach: Today I get to se one of my favorite bands of all time: Papa Roach. The day started off at 11:45am when I had to meet Katharina and Thomas at the train station. Our train left Oldenburg at 11:33, and arrived in Hamburg at 1:09pm. We didn’t have out tickets yet, and we couldn’t go to the club to pick them up until 8:00pm, so we had about 7 hours to walk the city like zombies. So that’s what we did! While walking we stopped in many stores including a really cool second-hand clothing store where I found an LSUMC(where my dad works) security uniform shirt! I didn’t buy it though because it was too small. But that was still really cool to find all the way over here in Germany! In Hamburg lives the majority of the millionaires in Germany. And it showed! My god did I see some fine cars! Included was a Dodge Viper GTS, a REALLY nice Ferrari (but I don’t know what kind…), and a Lamborghini Countach that I wasn’t able to get a photo of. Hamburg IS a beautiful city, but I didn’t really see anything worth taking a photo of EXCEPT for St. Nicholas Church. Killing Time In Hamburg: So we got tired of walking around Hamburg at about 5:30, so we started for the club hoping to catch a glance of Papa Roach before the concert. We arrived at Logo(the name of the club), at about 6:15 or so, to findPapa Roach casually standing outside! It is great because Papa-Roach isn’t famous here yet. I mean, their album, Infest, didn’t come out until about 3 weeks AFTER the concert! So here, their music in unavailable! Because of this, when we got there, there were only a few people at the club, and they were also just sitting around asking each other,”Is that the band over there?” “I don’t know, maybe. ” The Moment I Met Coby Dick: Then I walk up and just SCREAM, “COBY DICK!!!!!!” I got to talk with the band beforehand. And when I say talk, I don’t just mean talk, I mean REAL conversation! I talked with Coby for a good hour and a half finding out about his life, and answering HIS questions about mine! So, of course, I couldn’t pass this up without a photo of me and Coby. I just can’t believe that I didn’t take more pictures, though! The whole time talking with them, it just felt so natural and felt as if I didn’t NEED to take pictures of them because it was like I knew them or something. Oh well, I have my own memory, and so I know what happened, and that’s good enough. The Show Begins With Germany’s 4Lyn: We finally were allowed into the club at 8:00, which was good because at about 7:30 the band had to all go inside to do mic checks, and so we didn’t have them to talk to anymore. We get inside, and of course bought up all the souvenirs (just a t-shirt) and then had to wait yet another hour for the concert to actually begin. A German band 4Lyn opened up. But as with most German music groups, the vocals were in English, and so we could understand. They were actually quite good, and I look forward to seeing them again sometime. The Show We’ve been Waiting For: Papa Roach!: After 4Lyn’s performance, which lasted for about 1 and quarter hours, we had to wait 30 min while Papa-Roach setup. In this club, there were NO MORE than 200 people, and the stage was only about a foot high or so. Because of how small the club was, and how low the stage was, we were able to get REALLY close to the stage! My whole life I have seen these CRAZY people who ‘crowd surf’. I have always thought that they are so crazy for doing that, I mean, it just looks so dangers! But at this concert, I personally got to find out what a rush it really is, and also found that it is probably actually a whole lot safer being the one up there, then the one holding them up. I surfed 5 times! One time, I was having trouble getting up on the stage, and Coby saw this, so he reached out his hand, and pulled me up! That was great! THANKS COBY!!! Also, even better, the last song was of course ‘Last Resort’, And I was also, of course, front row, and he put the mic in my face, and I got to sing a few words of the song! WOW!!!! The concert was so great, that now writing about it, it feels like it never actually happened, because it was just so unreal! It was SOOOO GREAT!!!! The After Party In The Reeperbahn: So, after the concert, we talked again toPapa Roach and told them how great we thought the show was. And of course, I got Coby’s autograph. We talked again shortly and found out that they were going to go to the Reeperbahn (red light district), and go clubbing. We had planned to do the same, and so they asked if we would like to go with them! Of course, we said yes! At first, I thought that they were just being nice because they had to leave to go to the hotel and take showers. So I thought that the chance of them actually showing up at the meeting point was really slim. But we gave then a chance, and prayed, and they DID come! So we walked with them to the club called The Doll House, which is apparently the most famous club there. At this point I ran out of film! :( and Katharina had already run out at the club (Thomas didn’t have a camera), so I don’t actually have any photos from here on out. Darn it! We stayed with them till about 4:00, and then they had to go to the hotel to pack, and get on a plane to New York so that they could do an interview on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno the next day. [gallery link=”none” type=”rectangular” ids=”1431,1432,1433,1434,1435,1436”] A Night at the Train Station: So at this point, we told them goodbye and all that mess, and then we went to the train station to see what time a train would come. We ended up having to wait until 6:14 for a train. SO that means that I got to do for the first time what EVERY exchange student will end up doing at some point: sleep in a train station with the bums! YEA!! What fun, let me tell you! But hey, it builds character, right? Right! We couldn’t sleep so well because it was so cold, so we started walking around. While walking, Thomas found a cell phone! It turned out to be one of the best phones available on the market! So he reprogramed it so that its signal would match what is now his old phone. He told me, that he can get a completely new signal for his old one, which is actually quite nice, and then he will sell that one to me! FOR CHEAP! SWEET! The train finally came, and I was home at about 9:30am, with NO sleep, and so what did I do? Well, of course, I went to sleep, and then I slept until 6:00pm! AHHHH! It was great to sleep! But even more so, it was a GREAT weekend! Mission Accomplished: Ok, so there it is, I saw Papa Roach in concert, and what were all my Tioga people doing back home? You were dancing in uncomfortable formal-wear, listening to everyday music played by a DJ at Homecoming! Where would I have rather been? Truthfully, I wished I was home at the time. I was so homesick this night! But now, 2 weeks later, I am glad to be here, I am having such a great time! And hey, I will have Homecoming next year, and it will be great! GO SENIORS 2002!!! Yea, whatever……. If you are a Papa Roach fan, or have a story of meeting one of your favorite bands, please share it in the comments below! Feel free to also message me directly at @judsonlmoore! "

    "title": "Meeting Papa Roach On Tour In Hamburg Germany",
    "body": "2000/10/14 - The Journey To Papa Roach: Today I get to se one of my favorite bands of all time: Papa Roach. The day started off at 11:45am when I had to meet Katharina and Thomas at the train station. Our train left Oldenburg at 11:33, and arrived in Hamburg at 1:09pm. We didn’t have out tickets yet, and we couldn’t go to the club to pick them up until 8:00pm, so we had about 7 hours to walk the city like zombies. So that’s what we did! While walking we stopped in many stores including a really cool second-hand clothing store where I found an LSUMC(where my dad works) security uniform shirt! I didn’t buy it though because it was too small. But that was still really cool to find all the way over here in Germany! In Hamburg lives the majority of the millionaires in Germany. And it showed! My god did I see some fine cars! Included was a Dodge Viper GTS, a REALLY nice Ferrari (but I don’t know what kind…), and a Lamborghini Countach that I wasn’t able to get a photo of. Hamburg IS a beautiful city, but I didn’t really see anything worth taking a photo of EXCEPT for St. Nicholas Church. Killing Time In Hamburg: So we got tired of walking around Hamburg at about 5:30, so we started for the club hoping to catch a glance of Papa Roach before the concert. We arrived at Logo(the name of the club), at about 6:15 or so, to findPapa Roach casually standing outside! It is great because Papa-Roach isn’t famous here yet. I mean, their album, Infest, didn’t come out until about 3 weeks AFTER the concert! So here, their music in unavailable! Because of this, when we got there, there were only a few people at the club, and they were also just sitting around asking each other,”Is that the band over there?” “I don’t know, maybe. ” The Moment I Met Coby Dick: Then I walk up and just SCREAM, “COBY DICK!!!!!!” I got to talk with the band beforehand. And when I say talk, I don’t just mean talk, I mean REAL conversation! I talked with Coby for a good hour and a half finding out about his life, and answering HIS questions about mine! So, of course, I couldn’t pass this up without a photo of me and Coby. I just can’t believe that I didn’t take more pictures, though! The whole time talking with them, it just felt so natural and felt as if I didn’t NEED to take pictures of them because it was like I knew them or something. Oh well, I have my own memory, and so I know what happened, and that’s good enough. The Show Begins With Germany’s 4Lyn: We finally were allowed into the club at 8:00, which was good because at about 7:30 the band had to all go inside to do mic checks, and so we didn’t have them to talk to anymore. We get inside, and of course bought up all the souvenirs (just a t-shirt) and then had to wait yet another hour for the concert to actually begin. A German band 4Lyn opened up. But as with most German music groups, the vocals were in English, and so we could understand. They were actually quite good, and I look forward to seeing them again sometime. The Show We’ve been Waiting For: Papa Roach!: After 4Lyn’s performance, which lasted for about 1 and quarter hours, we had to wait 30 min while Papa-Roach setup. In this club, there were NO MORE than 200 people, and the stage was only about a foot high or so. Because of how small the club was, and how low the stage was, we were able to get REALLY close to the stage! My whole life I have seen these CRAZY people who ‘crowd surf’. I have always thought that they are so crazy for doing that, I mean, it just looks so dangers! But at this concert, I personally got to find out what a rush it really is, and also found that it is probably actually a whole lot safer being the one up there, then the one holding them up. I surfed 5 times! One time, I was having trouble getting up on the stage, and Coby saw this, so he reached out his hand, and pulled me up! That was great! THANKS COBY!!! Also, even better, the last song was of course ‘Last Resort’, And I was also, of course, front row, and he put the mic in my face, and I got to sing a few words of the song! WOW!!!! The concert was so great, that now writing about it, it feels like it never actually happened, because it was just so unreal! It was SOOOO GREAT!!!! The After Party In The Reeperbahn: So, after the concert, we talked again toPapa Roach and told them how great we thought the show was. And of course, I got Coby’s autograph. We talked again shortly and found out that they were going to go to the Reeperbahn (red light district), and go clubbing. We had planned to do the same, and so they asked if we would like to go with them! Of course, we said yes! At first, I thought that they were just being nice because they had to leave to go to the hotel and take showers. So I thought that the chance of them actually showing up at the meeting point was really slim. But we gave then a chance, and prayed, and they DID come! So we walked with them to the club called The Doll House, which is apparently the most famous club there. At this point I ran out of film! :( and Katharina had already run out at the club (Thomas didn’t have a camera), so I don’t actually have any photos from here on out. Darn it!
