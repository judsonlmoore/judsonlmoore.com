Tarah is a California native and a graduate from the University of Alabama (roll tide)! I discovered my love for travel while studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain and haven’t been able to sit still since. After graduation, I moved to Thailand to teach English and travel Southeast Asia. Basically, I’m a normal 23-year-old, trying to see the world before her mom guilt trips her into coming home!
