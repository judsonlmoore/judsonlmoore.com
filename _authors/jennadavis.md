A Canadian expat living in Düsseldorf, Germany. A mother, a wife, a lover of European flea markets, sweet treats, arts & crafts, and nature getaways. I spend my “standard” day managing [Life in Düsseldorf](https://www.lifeinduesseldorf.com/), an online English language publication for expats living in Düsseldorf, and spend my weekends exploring the world. I take great pride in treading lightly, taking the path less travelled, and being thankful for every opportunity that comes my way.
