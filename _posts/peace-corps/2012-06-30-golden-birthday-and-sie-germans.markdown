**Golden Birthday Party**

29 on the 29th is apparently all the reason needed to bring people from all over Kyrgyzstan to Talas. It was also the site visit weekend for the new group of volunteers (K-20). Dinner and then a house party. It was an epic evening full of friends, food, beer pong and many things which shall never ever be mentioned.

**Hiking in Besh Tash and Manas Ordo**

Sie German Frauen came down for my birthday weekend and somehow got me out hiking the day after my birthday bash. I am very thankful they did. The hike was beautiful!
