I recently participated in my first bike race! It was a really great experience but because I entered into the "professional" category and we were the last of 3 categories to race, I lost a lot of energy just standing around and the weather turned from a beautiful sunny morning to a bitter cold and windy stand storm by the time we hit the track. Combining that the really painful blister I got on my right foot from hiking in the canyons the day before, and a wreck that occurred on the starting line slightly spraining my ankle, I wasn't able to finish the race. That was a major bummer but the day was great just the same.

Yeah Bike!
