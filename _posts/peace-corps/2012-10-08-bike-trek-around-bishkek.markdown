I took a little trek around Bishkek and was smart enough to carry my camera with me. It was such a beautiful day! I tried to focus mostly on architecture in the beginning but then I discovered a great canal through the city with more natural area. I took this way outside of this city so I got away from the architecture but I think these photos will give you a nice idea of what are some typical visual elements to my time in Kyrgyzstan.

You can see more photos of Bishkek architecture in my other blog post, [More Bishkek Photos]({{ site.url }}/more-bishkek-photos/). And even more biking photos in my post, [Biking to Panorama]({{ site.url }}/life/biking-to-panorama/).
