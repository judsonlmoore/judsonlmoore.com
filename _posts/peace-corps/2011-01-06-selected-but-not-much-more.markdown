Woooo!  My status has been updated to SELECTED FOR SERVICE!  Most unfortunately there is nothing else to report at this time.  They only state

<blockquote>

> "Congratulations, you have been selected for service with the Peace Corps. More information is on it's way to you in the mail."

</blockquote>

So more sit and wait.  Though I have deduced a location.  I have no reason to believe that this is it but by applying the scientific method and process of elimination, I have found that the only country in Asia/Central Asia that has a Community Development Program that departs in late March is to the Kyrgyz Republic.

This is only based on the information available to me and some guess work.  I have no way to know that this is remotely accurate.  Hopefully I will know in a few days!

Selected.
