I'm just going to jump in and tell you the end of the story up front:

I had my interview and apparently it went well because I was nominated on the spot!

Curt (my recruiter) told me that he was scheduling interviews for 6 weeks from now but when he read my resume he thought that I would be very well suited for a program that closes nominations this Friday.  He bumped up my interview to ASAP and upon concluding everything told me that he was very impressed with me and asked if I would be interested in a program of this description:	

- Departs late March 2011

* Would be located in Asia/Central Asia

- I would work as a Community Developer

Now in the initial application I stated no preference to job or location.  I truly would be happy in any area of service that the Peace Corps offers and in any region of the world they serve.

When Curt described this program it was like he knew me better than I knew myself.  I knew immediately that this was exactly what I wanted to do and so of course I accepted the nomination.

Next step: Medical Review.  Le Sigh.
