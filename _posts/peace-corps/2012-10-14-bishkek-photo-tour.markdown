Waking up to a perfect October morning, I decided to make a Bishkek photo tour before the streets filled up. Â I grabbed one of the Cannon 600D cameras from [Kloop Media](http://kloop.kg) and hit the street of Bishkek to see if I could find anything interesting. I was lucky to have perfect weather and find some interesting subjects.
