I have arrived safely to Kyrgyzstan! The country is breathtakingly beautiful, the people are amazing and the food is even pretty awesome! This is my first time to access the internet and I probably won't have another chance for about a week. I will be receiving a cell phone on or around April 9, at which time my outbound communication will improve. Training so far is a lot of fun but does not allow for very much sleep. Language is coming along pretty quickly. I will meet my host family later this afternoon for the first time and will be staying with them for the next 3 months in the city of Kant. Please keep in touch, I love and miss you all very much. Talk to you again in a week or two!
