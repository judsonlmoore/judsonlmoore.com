My second host family in Talas, Kyrgyzstan, took me to the nearby Besh Tash (Five Stones) National Park. They have a "cowboy" who watches over their flock of sheep and various other animals. We plucked one from the heard and cooked it up river-side. It was delicious! By "it" I am referring  of course, to the single national dish of the Kyrgyz people: BeshBarmak (Five Fingers). I have eaten it many times. Only twice can I consider it to have been "good." This was one of these times and it was in fact, amazing.

Check out how cute my little sister is!
