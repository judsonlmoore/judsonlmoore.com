I bought a mountainbike so that I could go to the mountains. And so I did! [My lovely new ](https://www.judsonlmoore.com/life/giant-atx-770/)[Giant ATX770](https://www.judsonlmoore.com/life/giant-atx-770/)Â held up to the test. We road about 10 miles into the low-lying hills on the south-side of Bishkek to a well-known spot called "Panorama." This is like Make Out Point for Bishkek by night, but by day it is just a windy road to the top of a pretty big hill. We took the road up but came down directly off the side of the mountain. If I don't ride this bike another day in Kyrgyzstan, then it was worth having it just for today!
