Nooryz is the Islamic new year and is celebrated in the spring time as new life is emerging from the icy grip of winter. In Kyrgyzstan, celebrations typically include cultural performances of music and dance.

This video is from the Turkish-Manas Kyrgyz University in Djal, outside of Bishkek. What is really great about this video is its showcasing of a wide variety of performances from throughout Central Asia. Though many performances here are not native to the Kyrgyz people, they are all very popular in this country and are widely practiced and performed amongst youth. Thus, in this single event, I was able to capture a wide range of performances which will demonstrates nearly all of the music and dances which I have come to admire in Central Asia. I hope you will enjoy it as well.

My favorite is the men's dance from theÂ Caucasus. It starts around the 10 minute mark.

[_There are many photos which I took from this day at this event and at the capital's downtown festivities. At the time of this posting, I am unable to upload those photos but intend to update this post within a few days to include those images as well._]

And here are a bunch of photos.
