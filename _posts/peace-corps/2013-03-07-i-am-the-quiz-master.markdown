Last night I was the quiz master at my favorite local quiz night in Bishkek. We had a great turnout of 30 people consisting of locals, foreigners and all ages and professions. This weekly quiz night is a relaxed place to have fun and learning something new. This was my first time to be the quiz master and I am pretty happy with the questions I came up with so I thought I would share them with you. Pay attention to number 11-20; those are about Kyrgyzstan.

Come next time and join us. Every Wednesday evening at 8pm at The Dragon's Den, 557 Frunze (across from the Grand Hotel, next to Beirut cafe)
