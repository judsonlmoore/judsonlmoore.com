WOAH!  This is crazy!  My regional Peace Corps office (Dallas) received the additional follow up paperwork for my application yesterday and they called me today to setup an interview for TOMORROW!

My recruiter's name is Curt Baker.  Sounds like he is on my side with things.  I am excited to know him and I look forward to the interview… TOMORROW!

PS: Please excuse the all-CAPS words.. I think it's tacky and I usually don't do that, but I am pretty excited right now and want you to freak out (at least a little) with me!  THANKS!
