Ok so not much of an update here.  It took me weeks to do what I could have really done in a few hours or days at most.  Darn those essays!

I received an email from the Peace Corps a week ago stating that application were due by October 1 if an applicant hopes to depart in summer/fall of 2011.  I made the deadline, now it is just a matter of hearing back from them.

Holding my breath but trying not to think about it.
