In the year that I have lived in Talas I have made many visits to the Kyrgyz capital city, Bishkek. During this time I have been the beneficiary of great kindness and hospitality by those who live in the capital and have housed me and made me feel at home. These last few weeks I have been house-sitting for my friend, colleague and mentor, BettinaÂ Ruigies, and she allowed me to have some guests over. I recently learned from a Japaneese friend how to make sushi and so I hosted two sushi nights where I taught others how to do this as well. Thank you all who have supported me! I will appreciate your kindness forever!
