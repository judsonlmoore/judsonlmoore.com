All that stands between me and getting on the airplane is the actual invitation.  The Selection Committee in Washington DC couldn't even open my file until I was medically cleared.  Now that I am cleared, hopefully they can come to a decision quickly and I can find out what path my life will take.

If the selection committee has half of the enthusiasm for me that my recruiter had, then this should be a no-brainer for them.

Now I really am holding my breath.
