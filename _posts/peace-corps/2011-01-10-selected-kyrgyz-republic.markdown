I was right! Kyrgyz Republic here I come!

So where is that you ask?  Well I will tell you: Also known as Kyrgyzstan, it is a landlocked country bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the southwest and People's Republic of China to the east.

Some facts:

- The official languages are Kyrgyz and Russian

* The population is less than 6 million

- The whole country is the size of Nebraska

* The Kyrgyz ethnic makeup is a mix of Asian influence in the east and the Kyrgyz's in the north identified by their red hair and pale skin (I found my people!)

- 80% of the population identify themselves as Muslim

* I am not allowed to own or operate a motor vehicle while in service, but may if I so choose purchase a bicycle or a HORSE! (awesome)

- Most of the country is covered in year-round glacial snowcapped mountains

So there you go, thats where I will be spending the next 2+ years of my life.  I depart March 25, 2011 and return in June 2013.

Больше, чтобы прибыть (More to come!)
