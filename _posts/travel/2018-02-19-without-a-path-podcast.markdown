## Resources I mentioned during the interview

I talked about a lot in this episode of the Without a Path Podcast. Here are some notes and links to things I discussed in my conversation with Joe Baur.

- [Rotary Youth Exchange Program](https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/youth-exchanges) - I lived in Germany for 1 year when I was 17 years old with this free program which facilitates youth exchange between local Rotary Clubs all over the world. If you would like to be introduced to a Rotary Club near you, let me know and I will be happy to help you get in touch.

- [United States Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/is-peace-corps-right-for-me/) - In its 50th year since being established by President John F. Kennedy, I had the honor of serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kyrgyzstan, where I launched a journalism project which has touched hundreds of thousands of people since.

- [Where is Kyrgyzstan?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan) - "The Switzerland of Central Asia" is a landlocked country on the northwestern side of China. Its remoteness is only surpassed by its beauty.

- [Kloop School of Journalism](https://kloop.kg/) - This nontraditional school in Kyrgyzstan teaches Western-style journalism practices to youth. Their stories are published on one of Central Asia's most-read news sites.

- [Kyrgyz Media](http://kyrgyzmedia.com/) - This is the project that I launched while in the Peace Corps. Even if you don't read Russian or Kyrgyz, just looking through the photos in the posts will tell you a lot about the Kyrgyz People.

- [Friends of Kyrgyzstan Cookbook](https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.com/cookbook/) - This is a cookbook written by Peace Corps Volunteers in Kyrgyzstan. Many of the recipes are of traditional foods from the area and are easy to prepare.

- [World Nomad Games](http://worldnomadgames.com/en/) - It is like the Olympics for nomadic cultures. Teams from all over the world compete in a series of games which have been played for thousands of years. The 2018 World Nomad Games will be hosted in Issyk-Kul Kyrgyzstan from September 2-8, 2018. I will be there for sure, will you?

## The Sheep-Slaughter Video

During the interview, I mentioned a sacrificial sheep slaughter which temporarily converted me into a vegetarian. Joe thought it wise to include some of the audio in the Podcast episode, **which has stirred a lot of questions** about what the event looked like. Look no further, here is the full event for those of you whose curiosity is stronger than your stomachs.
