## Show Notes

I talked about a lot in this episode of Expat Sandwich. Here are some notes and links to things I discussed in my conversation with Marty Walker.

- [Rotary Youth Exchange Program](https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/youth-exchanges) - I lived in Germany for one year when I was 17 years old thanks to this free program which facilitates youth exchange between local Rotary Clubs all over the world. If you would like to be introduced to a Rotary Club near you, let me know, and I will be happy to help you get in touch.

- [United States Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/is-peace-corps-right-for-me/) - In its 50th year since being established by President John F. Kennedy, I had the honor of serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kyrgyzstan, where I launched a journalism project which has touched hundreds of thousands of people since.

- [Where is Kyrgyzstan?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan) - "The Switzerland of Central Asia" is a landlocked country on the northwestern side of China. Its remoteness is only surpassed by its beauty.

- [Kloop School of Journalism](https://kloop.kg/) - This nontraditional school in Kyrgyzstan teaches Western-style journalism practices to youth. Their stories are published on one of Central Asia's most-read news sites.

- [Kyrgyz Media](https://kyrgyzmedia.kg/) - This is the project I launched while in the Peace Corps. Even if you don't read Russian or Kyrgyz, just looking through the posts will tell you a lot about the Kyrgyz People.
