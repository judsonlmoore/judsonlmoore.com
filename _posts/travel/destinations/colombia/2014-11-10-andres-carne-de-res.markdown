## Andrés Carne de Res

We celebrated our final evening in Colombia in grand fashion with incredible food, drinks and dancing. The most famous place to eat in all of Colombia is [Andrés Carne de Res](http://www.andrescarnederes.com/). There are 2 locations in Bogotá. One is in the city center (fashion district) and is new and corporate feeling.

The original location is just outside of town. If you get a chance, go to the out-of-town location. It's like Hard Rock Cafe, Cracker Barrel, Tex Mex, BBQ and a hoarder-artist estate sale had a freak baby who turned out to be a culinary prodigy. Andrés Carne de Res is the best place to eat, drink, and party on the weekends. Closes at 3am. Prepare for steep prices on the drinks, but it's well worth it. The food is very reasonably priced and the best meat that I had in all of Colombia (which is REALLY saying something!)
