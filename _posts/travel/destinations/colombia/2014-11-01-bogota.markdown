Our first days were spent in the capital city, Bogotá. On the first day we explored the Monastery, [Cerro de Monserrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monserrate), which has breathtaking panoramic views of Bogotá. After some photo ops with local school children, we went down into the city center and spent several hours at [The Gold Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Museum,_Bogot%C3%A1). This museum is the most extensive collection of gold artifacts in the world. Located in a region of town called [La Candelaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Candelaria) (the old town), the museum is next to the national capital and some very interesting architecture.
