I've done a lot of sharing my experience in Kyrgyzstan and I often find myself repeating my travel advice for the country. Where to go? What to see? Who to meet? So I have decided to put together a sample itinerary. This is designed for someone who has limited time in the country, just 1-2 weeks. Of course, I was here for two years and I think there is no such thing as a "maximum" amount of time you should spend in one location, but the reality is that most of you will have to budget your time.

## Getting Around Kyrgyzstan

Firstly, how do you get around this beautiful country? Artiom, is how!

[Artiom](https://www.facebook.com/artiom.ulianchenko) - Is a Bishkek-based guide and has a 7-seater van and a 4X4 for more adventurous and winter travel. Competitive rates. He is super fun and respectful. Speaks excellent English. He deals more with adventure tourism so he might not be the best fit for a family vacation, but he really knows the country and how to show people a wonderful time. Even if you don't use him, get in touch and maybe he can put you in touch with someone else - cell: [+996 772 295514](tel:%2B996%20772%20295514) (for calling and for Whatsapp)

## **Karakol - Winter Ski Destination**

## **Food To Eat in Kyrgyzstan**

_(In order of my favorites)_
- Plov - PLOV!!!! Get the Uzbek plov.
- Bozo Lagman - Fried noodles with meat and vegetables. I love it so much.
- Shashlick - shish kabob, get the Duck, if available. You should go heavy on the onions.
- Akroshka - cold kefir soup. Easilly a favorite of mine. Good at lunch when it is hot out.
- Borscht - hot beet soup. You can compare it to mine. :)
- Lagman - pasta soup with meat and veggies
- Manti - ravioli-like, but a little larger. Usually has meat but Pumpkin and other fillings are possible.
- Pelmeni - very much like ravioli.
- Samsa - perfect 20-25som snack. Chicken is best.
- Ormo - layered noodle and meat thing…
- Besh Barmak - “Five Fingers” you eat this with your hands. If you can get it while staying with a family, that is the best, but if not, get it at a cafe. I don’t expect you to love this, but some people do. You must try it though, for me!
- Karut - the dry salty yogurt balls. Try a fresh one.

## **What to Drink in Kyrgyzstan **

- Arpa (beer)
- Nashe (beer)

- Juice Gram (100g of Vodka. Drink like a shot. Costs about \$.20)
- Kumiz (fermented horse’s milk)
- Fresh Horses Milk
- Kefir (yogurt-like drink)
- Chai… lots and lots of chai of BOTH kinds: red (black) and green tea.
- Coffee from Sierra Coffee
