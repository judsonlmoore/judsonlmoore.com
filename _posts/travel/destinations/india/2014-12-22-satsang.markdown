## The Satsang Temple

This weekend I accompanied my colleague and dear friend, Abin, with his family, to the [Satsang Vihar - Hyderabad](https://satsanghyderabad.org/). This ashram is home to a large [Satsang](https://www.satsang.org.in/) temple. Satsang is an Indian philosophy, which teaches a process of [spiritual meditation](https://medium.com/@AbinChowdhury/the-powerful-radha-soami-and-shabd-yoga-1a5e9078bf0e), which encourages people to listen to, talk about, and assimilate the truth. This typically involves listening to or reading scriptures, reflecting on, discussing and assimilating their meaning, meditating on the source of these words, and bringing their meaning into one’s daily life.

The ashram is a beautiful building of white marble surrounded by massive boulders, forest, and a compound of living quarters and facilities that accommodate Satsang pilgrims who travel here for periods of spiritual reflection.

## The Satsang Festival

On this day, there was a festival for the Satsang Sri Sri Dada 4th Anniversary Celebration. The festival had a wonderful performance of traditional Indian song and dance performed by the famous [Sonali Fine Arts Institute](https://www.facebook.com/Sonaliacademyoffinearts/). I was honored with being sat at the center of the front row and was even asked to come on to the stage to help pass out awards to some students. I was also given a nice framed memento of the ashram.

After the performances, we had a tasty dinner and then waited for sunset to observe the daily evening prayer.

Throughout the day, I was humbled by the overwhelming hospitality and eagerness of everyone who wanted to know me. The prayers, the dances, the music and the food were all equally fantastic. I greatly appreciate Abin, his wife Antara and daughter Abheepsa for including me in this festive day!
