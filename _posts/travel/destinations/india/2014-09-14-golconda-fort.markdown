I was a child when I first visited the National Natural History Museum in Washington D.C. I've never been one for jewels, especially diamonds, but ever since my childhood, I've been captivated by the Hope Diamond, which is notorious for supposedly being cursed. The history and mystery of that stone is very interesting, and it's origins are rather unknown, except that it was mined and originally housed just west of Hyderabad, India, at the once formidable Golconda Fort.

The fort's original buildings are over a thousand years old and have been extensively expanded over the centuries. The center of the fort rests atop a 100m-high granite hill, which is the source for many of the buildings' stones. The outer wall is seven miles long and it's architecture is reminiscent of European castles.

The massive inner compound is similar to Disney Land, in that you could be here for a week and likely not see everything. Ascending to the top of the hill is quite the trek, but the panoramic views of the city below are stunning.

As I explored the grounds of the fort, I felt like I was on a treasure hunt, imaging where the diamond once rested. It was a surreal experience to be in this place so far from home, but which had such a strong connection with one of my most vivid childhood memories. I frequented the fort while living in Hyderabad, and if ever I return to the area, I will no doubt visit here again.
