“Do it while your young.” I can’t tell you how many times I heard those words growing up. I heard them from family, friends, T.V., people I aspired to be like, and everywhere in between. I don’t know how many times it took hearing it before it sank in, but sink in it did!

In the past 10 years I have lived on 3 continents, in 4 countries, and in 12 cities. I am not a military brat. I am not a gypsy (though I might like to be one day!). I am not sketchy. I am certainly not running from anything or anyone. If anything, I am running to something, toward someone… though most of the time I don’t know exactly who, where or what that is. What I do know is that every time I make a move, it is smart. I am always strategic about it and I always make sure that my bases are covered on the other side.

One day I might expose the stories behind all of my moves. Some were “just because.” Others were for financial gain. Even others for fame. Once it was for love, but I moved on still after that. I love calling so many places home (see the list at [https://www.judsonlmoore.com](https://www.judsonlmoore.com)). I love that I can relate to so many people and the places that _they_ call home.

Truth be told, I don’t really have a home. “Home” is just a word to me.. it is a filler word for some great expression that I don’t yet know how to define. I did once have a home. It was in Kentucky, but that was 12 years ago. Am I searching for a new “home?” I don’t think so. I mean, I did watch the movie Up In The Air and was inspired to go shopping for luggage. (Yes, that really happened!)

Anyhoot. I digress. “Do it while you’re young.” That’s what they said. And they were right. I can’t keep this up. I will have to..nay, WANT to, settle down some time. But I am not there yet. Not quite.

More often than I care to think about, people express to me how they wish they “could” go off and do fun things like explore the world and move around gaining experiences and perspective. Sometimes these people have kids, are in school, married (or nearly so). And to them my heart goes out. They either missed the boat when they were young, or chose to do other things when they were young. There is nothing wrong in the choice, only in the regret. In all things, at all times, in all places, you must focus on the positive. Otherwise you will live a bitter life.

Then there are people who are young, smart, degree in hand, nothing tying them down, and they say to me, “I wish I could go off exploring the world!” And to them I say DO IT. Then come the excuses: ALWAYS. “I have this job…” “My family is here…” “I don’t know where I would go…” “I don’t have enough money to move…” etc etc etc…


<blockquote>note: I am the child of 2 Southern Baptist preachers (yes, mom too!), and my dad is a brilliant academic. They have very noble professions and have led very happy lives. My parents are the best parents I know of and they have done everything for me, always… but I was reared as far from a silver spoon in my mouth as you can imagine. I have worked since I was 14 and as many as 5 jobs + college at a single time to get where I am today… and everything, EVERYTHING I posses is a result of my own work, not a trust fund.. so lack of money is not an excuse either. Just a reflection for lack of motivation and creativity.   :)</blockquote>


Trust me. You don’t REALLY want to move around like I do. It takes real sacrifice. I have a belief that the long-term benefits will be great. That is what keeps me going. But it isn’t easy. If it WERE easy then everyone WOULD do it! (so they say)

But if you want to explore the world. If you want this connectivity with different people and cultures, but don’t know where to start, then shoot me a note. I would love to talk about it. What I find is that it is hard to relate my stories and experiences. Most people don’t ‘get it.’

Enough about that. I live without regrets. I love my life. I am just nearing a time when I want to share my super-awesome-crazy-experience-at-every-turn-know-more-people-than-Google-life with someone else.

Now accepting applications. While I am still young.
