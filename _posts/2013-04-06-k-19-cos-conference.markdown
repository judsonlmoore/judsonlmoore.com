This is it. This is the end. I made it. Yet somehow, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment. As I participate in the commencement sessions of my Peace Corps group for three days at this resort, all I can think about is how I need to be back at my site. There is still so much work to be done and precious few hours left to accomplish it all. I still have two months until I will leave Kyrgyzstan, so this also just doesn't feel like goodbye, even though the topic of the conference is exactly that.

We share stories with each other and with staff about our experiences as Peace Corps volunteers. In particular, we provide feedback about how future groups can be more impactful than we were. We reminisce about our beginnings as a group and all we have gone through. Regardless of if we were close to each other these last two years or not, we all relate to one another's stories of struggle and success. I will be forever grateful for this time and for all the people I came in contact with, especially the rest of the K-19 group.

As for me, I will see all of the people I am closest with before we depart from our service. So, back to work!
