In preparation for the 2012 Talas GLOW/TOBE Camp I needed to make a site visit to the camp site in the Besh Tash National Park. The camp had been here last year but I was not in attendance. I had a few friends come a long with me. The scenery is beautiful despite spring having not yet arrived. Entering the mouth of the mountains feels like something out of the Lord of the Rings. The photos spek for themselves!
