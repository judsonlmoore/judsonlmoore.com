I've had road bikes and mountain bikes, now I am settling into something right in the middle: a cyclocross bike! There is a vibrant cyclocross race culture here in Austin, and it's a whole other world of biking which I think I will really love. This is my first CX bike, and I love it! [Kona's 2015 Jake The Snake](http://2015.konaworld.com/jake_the_snake.cfm) cyclocross bike offers lots of higher-end amenities at a very reasonable price point. Here are the specs on the bike.
