M. Shafik Gabr is a prominent Egyptian businessman and philanthropist. He has established charitable foundations in Egypt and the United States to perform good humanitarian works of various sorts. In 2013, he began a fellowship program that encourages East-West dialogue. Each year since, the fellowship has supported 20 young professionals to come together for a month of travel, dialogue, and stimulating meetings with top leaders in Egypt and the United States.

I am a 2015 fellow. In this article, I share my notes from the fellowship in hopes not only to record my learnings from my participation but also in hopes that these notes might help future fellowship applicants gain a sense of what they are signing up for. 

My notes are as comprehensive as I could get them, but the most interesting learnings came, of course, from the person-to-person interactions that the fellowship facilitates. Please forgive any typos, grammatical errors, or incomplete sentences. Again, these are just notes. If you would like more information about the fellowship, feel free to leave me a comment below this article, [contact me](/contact) or visit the [Shafik Gabr Foundation website](https://eastwestdialogue.org/).

## East-West: The Art of Dialogue Fellowship, Part 1 (Egypt)

The first segment of the fellowship takes place in Egypt. During these 12 days, we visited Cairo, Giza, the Suez Canal, Alexandria, and Luxor. We had audiences with leaders in politics, the military, education, business, culture, and religion at each location.

### Friday October 16, 2015 (Cairo)

#### Mr. Rob Riemen, Founder, President & CEO of the Nexus Institute

***Topic:** Culture and Civilization: The Return of Political Extremism in the 21st Century*  
***Location:** Ramses Hilton Hotel*

- No notes

### Saturday October 17, 2015 (Cairo)

#### Mr. Karim Haggag, Deputy Director of Policy Planning at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

***Topic:** Shifting Middle East Landscape*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- Arab Spring - a reaction to the cries for freedom away from authoritarianism. 
  - The youth population drove this. 
  - They were striving for democracy. 
  - Within one year, the paradigm shifted.
- Muslim Winter - Authoritarianism reaction to the Arab Spring to try and maintain the tradition. 
  - This was a dismal display of power: Tunisia and Libya; failed to restructure.
- Arab Spring / Uprisings - began to be regionalized… Syria, UAE, Lebanon, etc.…
- 2005 - 2011 - Terrorism was not common in the Middle East, but made a return in the form of ISIS
- Options: worse → much worse
- Recovery: There are shimmers of hope in the Middle East:
- Egypt
  - a trend-setter in the Middle East
  - 1st parliament, constitution. Modern government
  - 1st to pursue peace; signed an Israeli peace treaty
- Role of the USA
  - Given all of the questions, turmoil, and other factors in Egypt / Middle East, in the USA even relevant? 
  - What role should the USA play?
  - Effective Counter-messaging does not come from the government. It comes from other related players in the same sector as the source of the extremism. i.e., non-radical Islamists were fighting radical Islamists.
- Terrorist objectives have moved beyond bombs and 9/11 events. Now they want Statehood in the region an opportunity to be legitimate.
- Muslim Brotherhood - oldest and most well-organized of the Islamist Movement leaders

#### Adel El-Adawy

***Topic:** U.S. - Egypt Think Thank: Egyptian Foreign Policy*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- The past four years have seen a lot of turnover and instability within high government roles
- Egyptian Foreign Policy Circles
- Regional Neighbors: Arab Circle
- African Circle: re-emerging now as an African leader
- Mediterranean Circle: Italy, France, Spain are big players
- International Circle: USA, U.K., Russia, China
- Major Issues
- Israel / Palestine
- Ethiopian Dam
- Immigration (Mediterranean issue)
- Climate change
- Think tanks that Egyptian leaders listen to most are government departments' official think tanks: not independent. Private think tanks are weak, under-resourced, and have little influence.
- Mix of Military in Politics:
- US / UK - clear division - however, the military does regularly advise politicians and lobbies for funding and authority
- Egypt - blurred lines - during all political changes, the military was the only institution that remained stable enough to run the country while all the other areas fell apart. Because the military stepped in, Egypt has not failed the way that Libya and Syria have.

#### Mr. Hisham El Khazindar, Managing Director of Citadel Capital

***Topic:** Egypt's Economic Development: Moving Forward*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- No notes

#### Dr. Mohamed Salmawy, President of Writers' Union in Egypt

***Topic:** Understanding Egypt's Constitution*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- Egypt has always been a secular government. The people have always been very religious (invented 1st concept of religion) but never accepted a religious government
- Public perception of the Muslim Brotherhood is that because they had a religious base in ideology, the people supported them because they believed the Muslim Brotherhood would enforce social justice, fight corruption, and have high moral and ethical standards. Within just months of the election, they turned radical with their policies and claimed no president's decision could be challenged. It also became clear that despite the high education of the Muslim Brotherhood, they had no idea about governing
- Ousting of Morsi - Not a coup d'etat - this was a military action by request of the people to toss out the government, not a military decision to act independently to take over the government and rule Egypt for themselves. Without this military action, Egypt would be in a civil war.
- Role of Youth - They are essential and won't change quickly. They drive sentiment for action, and because of social media and willingness to be vocal, they force accountability. They don't unrealistically demand change tomorrow, but they do demand evidence of progress today.

#### Mr. Paul-Gordon Chandler, Founder, and President of Caravan

***Topic:** Six Pillars Builds a Bridge: Creative Peacebuilding between the Creeds of the Middle East and West*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- "If you have a monkey for a friend, you'll never get your loincloth stuck in a tree."
- 6-Pillars of Islam (instead of the traditional 5)
- Jihad - fighting an internal struggle. We should jihad peace on Islam.
- The sliver is so bright that we can't see all we have in common on the dark side of the moon:
- Radical Islam vs. Islam
- Watch the new Omar Sharif Video (ask the speaker what video this is)

#### Ms. Lina Alorabi, Designer

***Topic:** A Journey through Design in Egypt*  
***Location:** Ramses ARTOC HQ*

- Traditional Ornate vs. Modern Minimalist furniture design

- Egypt is 90 M people
- Coalition between Egypt and Gulf Arab countries
- Election monitoring issues. Understanding that elections here might not look orderly from American standards but they are vastly improved every time
- During the Mubarak period, there were many talks about Egypt playing a lesser role in the Middle East. USA moved to weaken this relationship to increase instability and make it easier for the USA to influence the region
- Obama does not care so much about Egypt. Just not too concerned about the positions here
- The current American election has new interests from the last time. Last week, the democratic debate didn't talk anything about strategic relationships with the Middle East but focused on Asia relationships.
- Us congress ...
- Trying to make the balance between Russia-US-Egyptian relationship
- Egypt is Africa but has not spent a lot of effort pursuing African relations. They are trying to improve that now.
- Egyptian public opinion of America is damaged by Egyptian media perception of American policy

#### Mr. Aboul Fadl (Egypt's parliamentary elections) 

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Parliamentary elections began abroad yesterday and today in Egypt
- This is the very first multiparty election in Egypt. In the past, it was always mono-party
- Based on three laws
- 1st round 14M registered voters
- 2nd round, 28M registered voters
- Parliamentary elections are usually about local issues where family politics play an essential role. Therefore, tribal politics are essential
- The church plays a significant role because they can rally many Christian voters getting to the polls
- how much participation to expect? Some say no more than 30% in the 1st round. But this will vary based on region, as much as 45%. In a general election, it could be as much as 85%.

#### Mr. Mohamed Abass (US-Iran Agreement and its Repercussions)

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- No notes

#### Mr. Ahmed Kamel (Egypt: The War Against Terrorism)

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- In the 70s, terrorism was pursuing Shia law and only attacking government buildings and people. They sought a change in the political atmosphere. Also attacked police.
- Now it's different because they attack random places to cause harm to just any person and to strike terror by people coming to know that any site could be a target
- Also, today, the military is a target.
- result of the war
- Most terror events take place in Cairo but with the least amount of casualties
- Sinai alone represented 12% of terror deaths.
- Terror spiked since the 2012 constitutional referendum. Many more infrastructure attacks. 600 military and police casualties since then. Now Sinai has 40\_% terror deaths
- Egypt has massive borders that are hard to control. But the military has become much better at guarding them and identifying breaches, especially tunnels. Over 200 tunnels have been destroyed in recent years

#### Mr. Ali Bakr (The Muslim Brotherhood: A Historical Perspective)

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Started as a peace-oriented political movement
- Were able to create a belief that they are Islam and anyone against them is against Islam. Therefore many support them for this purpose but the brotherhood abuses this blind following by supporting terror groups and giving them credibility. The very vast majority of people do support this but also don't want to turn against the brotherhood because they believe that they are Islam
- Eventually, the military wing of the brotherhood grew too powerful to the point that they were ousted and became something else

'Transportation to the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Mohandessin'

#### Mr. Khaled Abdel Aziz, Minister of Youth and Sports

***Topic:** Developing Young Egyptian Leaders*  
***Location:** xxx*

***Location:** xxx*

- The Arab Israeli Conflict (the Arab Peace Proposal)
- The Prolonged Occupation of Palestine
- The US-Iran agreement and the expected shift in the balance of power in the region
- The Syrian situation
  - Four Issues
  - Israeli / Palestine 1-state / 2-state solution
- Sudan Dam
- Writing the constitution
- Why he left the Congress Party
- "We need a new regional order."
- With culture, regional security, laws, and actionable plans
- Optimistic about Egypt
- Will be 120M people in Egypt very soon. All plans must factor in this scale (education, infrastructure, energy)
- If the region is to be more stable, then it is necessary that all the factions in the region be part of the discussion
- Iran Deal
- It is good that we have made a deal and that it's this deal. It must go forward. But, now that one nation has a nuclear deal in the area, other countries must be given the same consideration. The military side should be prohibited, not the civil and energy side.
- Israel / Palestine
- There is a perception that Israel is getting **\_** because of everyone talking now about Syria. This is false.
- Israelis ought to reconsider their regional policies, but they won't; they only want to draw out endless talk with Palestine, which will never end.
- If a 2-state solution can't be worked out, fine, then make 1-state with rights for all.
- Regardless, they must come to work together to live together.
- Dam
- Of course, the other impacted countries have rights that need to be respected, but so does Egypt.
- "It takes two to tango, and we can tango if we have the right music."
- Egypt is a country in distress. Not yet out of the bottleneck.

### Monday October 19, 2015 (Cairo)

#### Mrs. Lisa Anderson, President of the American University in Cairo

***Topic:** American Univeristy in Cairo and education in Egypt*  
***Location:** AUC New Campus*

- AUC was founded in 1919. The original Campus is now the Greek Campus.
- 3rd University in Egypt
- New Campus built in 2008
- AUC is unique for its career services department. Not common in Egypt
- Education of facts is no longer relevant because all the world's facts are in your pocket. What is critical is education, which promotes critical thinking.
- AUC is the most expensive University in Egypt by a lot. However, the financial aid packages are excellent

#### Mr. Alaa Hashim, Chairman of Transcendium Limited Advisory For Independent Corporate Transformation, Advisor

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** AUC New Campus*

#### Mr. Hafez Al Mazari

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** AUC New Campus*

- 3 Nationalized Newspapers (\$3-8B USD in debt)
- Since 1934 government owns all broadcast frequencies (every terrestrial medium)
- 1952 Military Revolution of Egypt
- Germany was 1st to organize Arabic language outlets
- Q.A.
- Controlled media? No. Not in the USA (FOX) or Egypt. Why? Because ….
- No one "sitting in a dark room" directing media censorship. The media self-directs themselves to do as they believe they must. If they aren't sure what to say, they just say nothing until the global news covers a topic, then the Egyptian media will slowly report information, cautious not to overstep, education is critical, starts with ethics
- [Shorouk Newspaper](https://www.shorouknews.com/) is very harsh against the government, and they don't have any problems. However, this may also be because their readership is small, and it allows the government to point to them and say, "see? we don't censor!"

### Tuesday October 20, 2015 (Cairo)

#### Dr. Hala El Said, Dean of School of Economics and Political Science at Cairo University

***Topic:** Overview on Political-Economic Landscape*  
***Location:** Cairo University*

- Why so many military presidents? Because they are known to be the strongest leaders of the country and have the strongest discipline. They have the least corruption and do the most for the people. Because of this, civilians like military leaders. Also, the military is the most organized, and the people see this and vote for it.
- No k-12 education about what a democracy is. Only at university. K-12 only as national history education, which includes information about the importance of the military.

#### Mr. Abdel Ghaffar Shokr, Vice President at NCHR, with NCHR member: Mr. George Ishak, Mrs. Ragia Omran, Mrs. Neveen Mosaad, Mr. Kamal Abbas

***Topic:** Open Discussion*  
***Location:** National Center for Human Rights in Giza*

- National institution created by law, but independent of all other agencies. Oversees and studies all Human Rights issues in Egypt and advises policy on the Topic. Monthly and annual reports of violations. There are 120 researchers on the council from all political, racial, religious, gender, and other viewpoints.
- U.N. H.Q. advises and assists
- Secretary-General of African Societies
- tries to be Bridget between Arab and African countries while maintaining EU-US-Asia-Russia-Egypt balance
- (when I asked about citizen journalism, there was a lot of confusion. The answer revolved around social media, but this is, of course, unmonitored. There was mention of a radio station, but no details. UNESCO has activities here, and I should reach out to them.)
- Google:
  - The Supreme Council for the Regulation of Media
  - The National Press Organization
  - The National Media Organization
- "Different between citizen and community journalism."

#### Amb. F. Awad, the Arab League

***Topic:** The Effect of the Arab Spring on the M.E. Political Scene*  
***Location:** The Arab League*

- 1944 - established the Arab League. Oldest multi-national league in the world, even before the League of Nations.
- $65M budget only :(
- Iran - Arab nations are not the only players
- Arab League - Just helps the member states implement the decisions they make
- Palestine / Israel
- everyone is tired of talking about it, but it's a shame we can overcome it.
- politicians have to decide on this, and they are too tired with a dead dialogue to get the voters to pressure American (for example) politicians
- will take another 70 years - marketing efforts to middle America to count the Israeli lobby

#### Honorable Mona Markram Ebeid, Former Parliamentarian and Speaker

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Youth
- Youth complain about the government, but then they don't vote because they see no benefit
- "Thank goodness the Islamists also don't vote."
- Reasons for the Revolution
- Police brutality
- Rigging of the 2010 elections
- Burning of the Two Saints Church in Alexandria, where 20 Christians were murdered
- 20 days and the revolution started by a rally of youth in social media
- Hopes for the future
- Dignity is the issue. NOT democracy. The west forgets this. Egypt used to be #1 in the Arab world with soft power: respect, allies, etc., but they lost that over the years
- Jobs
- Food
- President Sisi's popularity
- Mubarak's overthrow after one year by 30M Egyptian citizens who asked the military for help
- Military agreed and gave a 1-week notice to Mubark to either call for elections or step down. When the clock expired, and Mubarak had not complied, the military moved in and took over their plan. The military stated the plan, followed the plan, held elections, and the people were very thankful and voted the military leader into the presidency because they trusted only him.
- West was against this at first because Mubarak was the democratically elected president, and the west wanted the president to have his term and be removed democratically. Egypt doesn't care about this, reminding that Hitler was also democratically elected.

#### Dr. Mostafa El Fiky, Political Expert

***Topic:** Egypt from Revolution to Reform*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- 1952 - political revolutions had the rhetoric of "Best Egypt Ever," which is, of course, not true. Revolution comes as a result of the worst of times and only makes more divisions
- Egypt is not the same as the Arab Gulf States on the Syrian issue
- Different from Yemen
- Disagreements with Saudi Arabia et al. about what to do w/ Syrian president
- Egypt not in a position because the military is occupied in Sinai, Western border and anticipate Southern aggression
- Egypt does not have diplomatic relations with Iran
- To restore relations does not signify love for Iran, but it is important to be speaking and building mutual understanding in hopes of forming relations
- Must disengage from religion and politics—sectarian state essential.
- Muslim Brotherhood: 2 problems
- 1 - Shared state secrets with broader Muslim Brotherhood organization in other countries
- 2 - Blurred lines of state to the Islamic World

#### Mr. Ziad Aly, CEO, and Founder of Alzwad for Economic Development

***Topic:** Entrepreneurship for a New Egypt political changes in Egypt*  
***Location:** xxx*

- 70k followers on Twitter
- Would take us on a cross-Egypt bike tour, seeing the real life of people.
- Problems with your engagement post-Mubarak. They led a revolt against him and then stopped participating
- Website built by youth: [yadaweya](https://www.yadaweya.com/)
- Visit the Center for Independent Music in Zibaway (spelling?)
- Zum**Answer:**  vegan restaurant (bring it to Austin!)
- [Madamasr](https://www.madamasr.com/) (independent media)
- Believes there is a huge opportunity to work with youth and the media

#### Dr. Noah Bakr **get her deck**

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Political Science Professor at the American University of Cairo (AUC)
- Literacy rate is based on a 3rd-grade level and above. This is a problem because the statistics show high literacy in Egypt, but it's at a very low standard with little critical thinking skills.
- January 25 Revolution wasn't because of the economy; it was because of the Egyptian identity being threatened by Islamist extremists (Muslim Brotherhood)
- 1.1:1 M/F Ratio
- Population grew in 1981 - today from 44M - 90M. Wow! This is due to increasing unemployment, so Egyptians had more free time to make families, returning to traditional values that larges families bring prosperity, but it hasn't worked out that way (doesn't work in modern economies)
- Youth engagement is critical

#### Dr. Tarek Ragheb, Founding Chair of the African Business Aviation Association

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Egyptian-American. Served in USAF and was in high-ranks at CENTCOM.
- Special Envoy to Uganda
- "Arab Spring" is a term coined by the west. It doesn't make sense!
- Prefers dealing with republican insults than leftist over accommodation because political Islam is not the type of thing to become moderate by exposure to liberals
- Political Islam is the single greatest threat to the West and the Modern World
- Inclusion breeds moderation = True (for ordinary people) BUT with people whose supreme doctrine is a 1400-year-old document, they will not compromise, and you are wasting your time trying to negotiate with them or moderate them
- "If you dialogue with and accommodate these people, they will exploit you until they are strong, and then they WILL kill you. This is a fight for your survival. Understand that first."
- "The Middle East doesn't need democracy at this stage. They need governance to bring order. Democracy will come later. America took \~250 to get to today, and for the first 200 years, African Americans and women couldn't vote. Why does the Middle East have to evolve overnight? Give them 200 years too!
- [De Birs Yachts](https://www.debirsyachts.com/) ← 100% Egyptian
- "Turkish president Erdoğan is ISIS in a suit."

### Wednesday October 21, 2015 (Ismailia)

#### Gen. Mohamed Keshky, Assistant to the Minister of Defense and a Welcome Reception by Gen. Sedky Sobhy, Minister of Defense

***Topic:** Egypt – U.S. Military Cooperation*  
***Location:** Ministry of Defense*

- Role of Egyptian Armed Forces in leading U.N. Peacekeeping Mission
- Egypt in 1945 signed the U.N. charter (1 of 50)
- 1st U.N. Peacekeeping mission was in Egypt in 1949 for an Egypt / Israel mission
- Egypt trains many of the African Union troops
- Egypt is the largest troop force of U.N. peacekeepers
- 1st peace treaty in history was signed in Egypt ([Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty, 1259BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty))
- Terrorism is not in all of Sinai; only three cities there
- **Question:**  Any efforts to reach out to USA voters about Egypt's reality?
  - **Answer:**  Not able to do. Only a few in D.C. care about Egyptian politics. Experience shows that USA Media just looks to prove their views and opinions.
- Military plays 1% role in large construction projects, only to supervise, but not to manage or conduct the work. Keeps projects on schedule and prevents corruption
- Egypt - U.S. vs. Egypt - Russia in Syrian policy
- Egypt does not intervene in other nation's affairs at this time because they are busy focusing on their recovery for the last three years. However, if there is an internal/civil Call to Action to go to Syria, they will maybe. But all is complicated there, and Egypt must focus on its anti-terror initiatives
- Lessons learned from Saddam Hussein means Egypt must reconsider what to do differently in Syria.

### Visit to Suez Canal

#### Meeting with Vice Admiral Mohab Mamish, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority

***Topic:** The New Suez Canal: The Opportunities to revive Egypt Economy*  
***Location:** xxx* 

- Original open date in 1869 - 1M Egyptians built the canal, 100k died making it
- $8.92B provided by the citizens in 192 days via bonds to build the new canal
- The canal is not just about the revenue. It is also for the future opportunities for redundancy, added industry, manufacturing, and strategic viability of the whole region
- Building the new Suez Canal was said to take 5-years by engineers' assessment. The admiral overseeing the project was ambitious enough to say he could do it in one year. President Sisi came to the admiral's announcement event and told him in advance that he would be making a small request but didn't mention what it was. Then, when the admiral announced the 3-year project, President Sisi requested it is done in an impossible 1-year! But they succeeded in exactly one year, and they are open for business! [Celebration Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqTyOsEcV8), [short documentary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K98knUJ3HE)

### Thursday October 22, 2015 (Cairo)

#### Need the speaker here <----

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** American Resource Center in Egypt*

- Also has an office in San Antonio, Texas
- Humanities research. No science unless as part of archeology
- M. Shafik Gabr Foundation For Social Development (Egypt)
- An essential part of heritage preservation is the people, not places, artifacts, monuments, or architecture (as is often manifested in work performed)
- Selection Criteria
- Originally was mandatory to have an even split between Islamic, Coptic, and Pharaonic sites. This is laxer now, but it's essential to try to maintain this
- Socioeconomic value, historical value, and archaeological significance as well as future economic value.
- Socially useful purpose which will hopefully be maintained in the future (mosque/church)
- Or: "adaptive reuse" to be useful in the future. "the pyramids were not built as tourist attractions, but there is a clear economic value there."
- Egyptology research and books are 30% German, 30% English, 30% French, 10% all other languages

#### H.E. Amb. Hamdi Sanad Loza, Deputy Foreign Minister for African Affairs

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs*

- **Question:**  Efforts of the Ministry's press office to work with the foreign media?
  - **Answer:**  Perception internally is that the Egyptian government spends too much time speaking with each other and not enough time talking with the rest of the world. They do work with the foreign media, but it seems too impossible to impact American Media's views, especially in the USA.
- Welcome to discuss suggestions for improved EN-US Media relations*
- ISIS Situation
- Arab world skeptical about the USA in Syria because the USA has promised to invade Iraq and make it a model of freedom and democracy in the region. USA failed and is making dismal efforts, so the USA's credibility is very low. The region doesn't want the USA involved in-part because the USA breaks promises, fails goals, and creates situations that breed terrorism.
- Counter Messaging Activities
- ISIS's message is very attractive to youth with troubled backgrounds who prefer to see a man with a gun, 2-3 women, and speaking of fighting for a new caliphate. Especially youth already in trouble. These youth are not scholars and don't have the advantage of better life options, so it becomes a great chance for them. The fight to counter this will be long and hard.
- **Question:**  If the MFA could assign one task to the Gabr Fellows to improve Egypt-West relations, what would it be?
  - **Answer:**  Find and create professional means by which to share Egypt's realities in the west. How to grow this and how to scale it.
- I suggested a media relations organization with Government advisement. He suggested that the government not be too close to any such efforts to avoid suspicion and lack of credibility.

#### Mr. Ahmed El Alfi, Founder & Chairman of Sawari Ventures

***Topic:** Transforming the Startup Ecosystem in Egypt*  
***Location:** Greek Campus*

- Mr. Alfi lived a few years in Austin
- It is similar to Capital Factory / WeWork but doesn't offer V.C. or mentorship. They are strictly a facility that builds culture and encourages collaboration and relationships to develop.

#### Mr. Hany el Missery, Governor of Alexandria

***Topic:** xxx*  
***Location:** Alexandria Governorate*

- Appointed in February 2015
- Egyptian - American. He grew up in Alexandria. Degree from UCLA. He spent most of his life in the USA and Switzerland. He was CEO of a major petroleum company. The Egyptian government asked him to serve and agreed, but only if it was in Alexandria.
- Governors in Egypt are not elected but are appointed by the Prime Minister
- Alexandria has 30% of the cotton industry and 40% of the petrol industry in all of Egypt
- 5M residence + 3M seasonal workers in summer. 33km of shoreline
- Goals: Health and Education. Everything else is extra
- Proposal to build a series of 3km x 1km islands, each dedicated to different sectors (education island, medical island, etc.) Similar to the UAE.
- Need to create tourism operations reality that the best tourist sites are elsewhere in Egypt. Alexandria has only 1-2 places, starting to attract ex-pats in other ways (like conferences), but this means building hotels and other infrastructure.
- Women - 1st deputy governor and district director ever in Egypt to be women are now here by this governor's appointment
- Alexandria doesn't view people by gender, faith, or race. They are Alexandrians and very proud of their diversity and this identity being maintained at all costs.
- Converted trams into cafes, and now they earn 10k L.E. / day instead of the 3k L.E. / day they were receiving a year ago. Tons of other innovations in public facilities, services, authorizations/startups (Microsoft), etc.
- Youth
- Facebook: [Live Alexandria](https://www.facebook.com/Live.Alexandria)
- WhatsApp Groups
- Youth Parliament - youth aren't being constructive. They just want. They have this forum, but they only come with problems and not suggesting solutions, but the governor is trying to engage them.
- Infrastructure
- Sewage: City is growing too fast, and sewage is overflowing. The Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) model is the way to address this. Not common in Egypt, but it's a proven model in the rest of the world and should be used here.
- Buildings: taking down buildings in violation of codes. "sweet grandmother problem."
- Trash: 100k of 15M / month is being paid by the government to the trans contractor. Big deficit problem.
- lol: he fired a district head via WhatsApp
- Has 13k employees but has only met 12 of them because the governor's office was burned down and everyone is scattered. He only needs ten people to get the job done.

### Monday October 26, 2015 (Luxor)

#### Dr. Ahmed El Tayeb, Grand Sheikh / Grand Imam of Al Azhar

***Topic:** Open Discussion*  
***Location:** Al Azhar*

- The institute reaches
- 2M k-12 students
- 10k university students
- \~50 institutes in Africa and Asia
- \~80 University faculty
- 40k foreign students
- Education is free (tuition, fees, room/board, books, etc.)
- "There is only 1 Islam. Is teaches love, acceptance of others, accepting and co-existing with others, no matter who you are."
- "To see violence and harm caused by others in the name of "Islam" is confusing and outrageous.
- 132 countries represented in these schools. Scholarships available for all students
- Funded by the endowment, Egypt government, private donors, and several other nations, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE
- The Grand Imam is the top scholar at the Al-Azhar
- Believes it is programs like the Gabr Fellowship which creates the dialogue necessary to lead to better East-West understanding and cooperation and bringing down the walls that are dividing us.
- There is no room in Islam for struggle or the imposition on to others for how they should be
- The Grand Imam is from the west bank of Luxor
- **Question:**  some Imams say things on Friday prayers that incite violence and fear. What is Al-Azham doing about this?
  - **Answer:**  Of 90k mosques in Egypt, maybe 10 speak radical things. This is a low statistic, but it does cause a problem. Every 6-months, Christian priests and Imams come together to discuss this and then take a stance on the streets together to discuss with the public what has been discussed
- **Question:**  Does the Grand Imam represent Sunni or Shia Islam?
  - **Answer:**  There is only 1 Islam. The sects of Islam still have the same one God and believe the same things, just express it in a different way
- Christians are members of one church, and this builds community and understanding. In Islam, a mosque is a mosque, but you can also pray where you are, which means that this strong sense of community Christians have doesn't exist in Islam. Probably this is the cause of some perception problems.
- Judgement Day'srolee in Radicalization: >1% believe in this ideology, but this is what fuels radicalism' (kill infidels and get 21 virgins, etc..) It's ridiculous.
