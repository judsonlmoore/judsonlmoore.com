Just before I published my first book, [Exponential Happiness](/book/), my publisher, LeanPub, honored me with a feature on their podcast for authors. We had quite a long chat, but it is pretty interesting, if I may say so myself. 

Len Epp is Leanpub's co-founder. During his interview, we discussed: 

- My background
- The Rotary summer camp that changed my life
- My youth exchange year abroad in Germany
- My parents' activism for the rights of people with disabilities and their families
- My time in the Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan where I established a network for journalists
- My brief high-rise construction career in India
- My eventual return to Germany
- My book (of course!)
- My experience as a self-published author

The full transcript and shownotes can be found on [the LeanPub Frontmatter Podcast website](https://leanpub.com/podcasts/frontmatter/judson-l-moore-12-07-19).

## About LeanPub

LeanPub is a digital-first platform for authors to get published fast. By their own words:

> Leanpub is the combination of two things: a powerful ebook and course writing platform, and an online storefront where you can buy our authors' ebooks and courses.

When I was writing my first book, I saw two major challenges: 
1. how to approach and structure the content of the book
2. the mechanics of getting the book from my computer into a reader's hands

Any author should be more focused on the first point than on the second. With LeanPub, I found a way to keep m focus on my writing and not be stressed about delivering the final product. 

By writing my book in markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, where simple things like ``#`` make a heading and ``**bold**`` makes the output bold, I was able to create documents which LeanPub could turn in to a published book. I even used bitbucket for version controlling of the book. 

LeanPub generously offers their authors to take the reader-ready files to any outlet for sale without any claim of ownership. Of course you can [buy the book on LeanPub in digital format](https://leanpub.com/exponentialhappiness), but I also could deliver the same files to Amazon for purchase there of both the [paperback and Kindle editions](https://amzn.to/2pDAcA6).
