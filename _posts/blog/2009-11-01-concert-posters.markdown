My first job after university was as a concert promoter at TCB Concerts (now [Green Machine Concerts](https://greenmachineconcerts.com/)). I worked with some of the biggest names in American music during that time, including Taylor Swift, the White Stripes, ZZ Top, and Eric Church. 

Below are a collection of concert posters from the shows that I was a part of producing.

**Update:** Jim Green, my friend, mentor, and legendary independent music promoter, the founder of Green Machine Concerts, passed away in June 2020. His obituary can be read [here](https://eu.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2020/06/02/memphis-concert-promoter-jim-green-dies-obituary/3127194001/).
