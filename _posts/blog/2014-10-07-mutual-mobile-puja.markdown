## Blessings for Mutual Mobile Hyderabad

In celebration of construction beginning at the new Mutual Mobile office in Hyderabad, the builders organized a [puja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)) to be performed. A puja is a widely-used term for a Hindu prayer ritual to honor and worship one of the deities. In this case, the puja is seeking the blessings for successful construction and profitable business to always come to Mutual Mobile in this space.

Our CEO's parents live in Hyderabad, so they attended the event as honor guests.
