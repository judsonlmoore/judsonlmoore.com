This beautiful road bike was hand crafted, painted and assembled in Austin TX by Giano Fabricata. I bought it in June 2013 as my first road bike, and it has defied (my understanding of) the laws of bike-physics ever since! This machine is inspirational on the road!

Since every part was hand selected and assembled, I have put a list of parts here. The value of just the parts is over \$6500. That doesn't even include the cost of paint, labor and tuning.
