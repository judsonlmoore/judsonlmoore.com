Today I gave an hour-long presentation at the [University of Texas to a Peace, Conflict Resolution and Global Ethics Symposium](https://www.utpcr.org/) where I spoke in large part about my Peace Corps projects and how I continue to serve the Central Asian journalism community from Austin. The students were very engaged, asked great questions and flooded me with awesome feedback and discussion after the talk concluded. Here is the presentation I shared with them.
