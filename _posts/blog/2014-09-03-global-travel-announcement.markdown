1 year, 3 months and 7 days ago I moved to Austin Texas. Since that time I have only spent 10 days traveling. It's time to get a move on! I write you today to announce some exciting travel plans I have for the remainder of 2014. If you are going to be in my vicinity, let me know and lets try to meet up!

Well there you have it. My adventure continues!

I have done a very poor job keeping up my blog these last 15 months. Rest assured, I will have lots that I want to share with you in the next four months and I hope that you will continue to read what I have to say and send me your positive thoughts as I traverse the globe.

More soon!
