## Dear Rotary Club of Alexandria

_As read by Ed Caplan to the Rotary Club of Alexandria members at their regular Tuesday lunch meeting._

Tuesday August 18, 2015

16 years ago, the Rotary Club of Alexandria sponsored Judson Moore to participate in Camp RYLA. Literally half a lifetime later, he is at this moment being introduced to the Rotary Club of Austin Texas as their newest member. Judson asked that I take a moment to recount his journey over these last 16 years as a testament to that investment we made in him, and to encourage us to continue making similar investments in CENLA youth.

Here is what Judson writes to our club today:

Dear Rotary Club of Alexandria,

Today is a day that I’ve been looking forward to for half my life. The journey I’ve been on since we first met has been amazing and I do try at every opportunity to make you proud. Please allow me a moment to share with you where your impact has led me.

After Camp RYLA, I went on to serve as a Rotary Youth Exchange Student for one year in Oldenburg Germany. Before starting college, I spent six months backpacking Brazil, alone, where I volunteered with local Rotary projects throughout the country. Back in the United States, I became active in Rotaract and went on to serve in leadership roles at the local, district and international levels, as well as being the Program Chair for the 2011 RI PreConvention in New Orleans.

Through all of this, I have had a myriad of professional experiences striving to make the world a better place. I worked as the Emergency Response Planner for the American Red Cross in southern Louisiana during post-Hurricane Katrina, traveled the United States with the biggest names in music entertainment as a concert producer, and then decided to get back to my roots and dedicate myself to serving humanity in the United States Peace Corps.

Now residing in Austin Texas, I contribute to the growth of the Austin business community as the co-founder of the Brazos Technology District and as part of the Operations Team at Mutual Mobile. Later this year, I will travel to Egypt as part of the Shafik Gabr Foundation Fellowship, which aims to encourage collaborative projects between Americans and Egyptians. In the coming year or two, I hope to begin a career with the United States State Department as an American Diplomat; I’ve already past their exams and received a Top Secret clearance, but the waiting list does take quite some time to get through.

In these short 16 years, I feel like I have had lifetimes of experiences. I recognize and remember at every one of life’s intersections how I have moved down this road and it all started in 1999 when this club supported my candidacy to participate in Camp RYLA. I thank you for what you have done for me, what you have done for my generation, and for what I am certain you will continue to do for those whose journey is about to begin.

Your Fellow Rotarian,
Judson Moore
