Keeping with tradition and always being on the move, I have now moved into a new apartment after only being in Bishkek for two months. This makes the 5th place I have lived in Kyrgyzstan and my short 17 months here. This place is a real find. Right in the center of Bishkek, newly renovated and the right price (about $250). The kitchen is still being finished and a wardrobe is being installed in the bedroom, but this should give you a good idea of how I am living these days.
