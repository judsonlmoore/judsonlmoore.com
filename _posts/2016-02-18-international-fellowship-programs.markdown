International fellowship programs are an excellent way to see the world, learn valuable lessons and get someone else to pay for it all. Many fellowships are tied to current degree-seeking students and researchers, therefore, you might reasonably assume that when you read "fellowship" you need to be in school. This is not true. There are many professional fellowships, as well as opportunities for mid-career international education and research.

Here are a few programs from which I have personal experience. I'm happy to offer tips for applying to these, and would love for you to expand this list by leaving a comment below or reaching me at [@judsonlmoore](http://twitter.com/judsonlmoore)!

## 1. East-West: The Art of Dialogue (Egypt, UK, USA)

Encouraging East-West dialogue between young professionals in Egypt, the UK, and the United States, this fellowship selects 20 young professionals from a variety of professional backgrounds and tours them for four weeks throughout Egypt and the United States to meet with prominent leaders in business, politics, the arts, education and faith. Upon completion of the travel period, fellows are given the opportunity to execute a self-authored \$100k international project. Applications go live in the spring and travel is in the fall. [Learn more](http://eastwestdialogue.org).

## 2. The Rotary Peace Fellowship (Worldwide)

Rotary International has invested in peace leaders for generations. The Rotary Peace Fellowship offers a fully funded master's degree program at one of several partner universities around the world. If you want to study and work in the field of peace and conflict resolution, this is the fellowship for you! Write a comment below and I can help connect you with your local Rotary Club to get you started. [Learn more](https://www.rotary.org/myrotary/en/get-involved/exchange-ideas/peace-fellowships).

## 3. The Bosch Foundation Fellowship (Germany)

Focusing on transatlantic issues, this 1-year opportunity is for early and mid-career professionals with a demonstrated interest in advancing international relations. After a crash course in the German language, participants are placed in jobs at participating organizations around Germany. The included housing, stipend, and even a bonus to support your accompanying family will make sure you don't have too much stress while you grow with this amazing fellowship! [Learn more](http://www.bosch-stiftung.de/content/language2/html/959.asp).

## 4. Fulbright Fellowship (Worldwide)

This esteemed fellowship offers research, study and teaching opportunities for Americans almost anywhere in the world. Likewise, they accept applicants from all over the world to come study in the USA. The opportunities here are seemingly endless and applicants are offered a high degree of flexibility in proposing their area of study and geographic assignment. If you want to write your own ticket and work autonomously in pursuit of your advanced degree, start here. [Learn more](http://www.iie.org/en/Fulbright/).

## 5. Peace Corps Master's International (USA + Worldwide)

If you're interested in longer-term sustainable international development, this is a great twofer. Enroll in a participating master's degree program and after your course work, the Peace Corps will send you into the field for your thesis research. Upon completion of the program, you will have a master's degree and be awarded federal NCE status (Non-Competitive Eligibility) which will, in addition to the amazing Peace Corps experience, place you high on everyone's hiring list! [Learn more](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/university/mastersint/).
