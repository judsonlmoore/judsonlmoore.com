The purpose of a resume is to get you an interview. It needs to be catchy (but not tacky), impressive (but not long), and most importantly: well-organized (yet still creative). Everyone has their own style preference in writing a resume, so I am not going to get into that here. The purpose of this article is to provide some high-tech resume tips which can be applied to any resume. However, you can gain access to **my awesome high-tech resume template** along with lots of useful notes when you [subscribe to my email list]({{ site.baseurl }}/subscribe/). So go do that now. It's ok. I will stay here and wait for you to come back. :)

## Use Google Docs

If you are not already a user of Google Docs, you should go [register for an account](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) right now. The benefits of Google Docs are massive, and to get the most out of this article, you will need a Google Docs account.

**Key Benefits**

1. Always have a backup

2. Export into .pdf and .doc file formats

3. Easy collaboration (mom, mentor, friend at xyz company recommending you)

4. Share settings allow you to keep documents private or accessible to others. For the purposes of this article, you will want to set your resume document share settings to "anyone with the link...can view."

## Embed Links

Wherever possible, make your text link out to a reference. This is easily done by highlighting the text which you want to convert into a link, and then pressing the **command+k** keys. A small dialogue box will pop up and you can type or paste a URL into that. Click "apply" and the text is now a clickable link!

Here are some things to consider linking:
- Employer websites
- Email addresses of references
- Certificates
- Published work

Be sure to style your links in an attractive way. I prefer to style my links to blend in with the rest of the text so that the document is attractive when printed, even though it means you can't visually see the links, it makes for a nice subtle detail recruiters notice when they float their cursor over the document.

You should also utilize a URL shortening service, such as [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [goo.gl](https://goo.gl/) so that you can track how often and when each link gets clicked. This data can be super useful to you during your job pursuits.

## Make It Easy To Send Email

This is a little bit of a web developer's trick, but it's easy to do and I think it shows you to be innovative. Here is the link that I have on my resume for my contact email.

> mailto:getintouch@judsonlmoore.com?subject=I%20Read%20Your%20Resume!&body=Hey%20Judson!%20I%20was%20reading%20your%20resume%20and%20wanted%20to%20get%20in%20touch...

- **mailto:getintouch@judsonlmoore.com** this is the link base, which signifies the link should send an email to an email address.

- **?subject=** this extension to the link base allows you to customize your own subject line for the draft email which will be composed by clicking the link. The **%20** tells the computer to insert a space between the words.

- **&body= **this allows you to provide a custom start to an email. I've gotten really good feedback from recruiters for providing a start to the email they are going to write. It's something no one else is doing, and that helps me stand out from the crowd, which is my #1 mission with my resume.

## Download Links

Here is the URL to my Google Docs resume. The underlined part of this URL is the custom ID for this specific document. That jumbled mess of letters and numbers just says "Judson's Resume" to Google Docs. The **bold extension at the end** says that rather than open the document, download it in a certain file format. You can use these extensions:

> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtH76fNIOcY7qPpdwEZK9Cv8fu4axDvZGHIymPJUSJw**/export?format=pdf**

- **export?format=pdf**

- **export?format=doc**

- **export?format=txt**
