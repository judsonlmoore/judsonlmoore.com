My friend Linda has a friend named Almanbet who invited her to the mountains for a cook out. I got invited as a tagalong and we had a blast. We went in two cars but one broke down so we had to pile, very unsafely, into the other. The mountains were beautiful and the food was amazing. Almanbet didn't bother to tell anyone it was his birthday but one of the girls with us revealed the secrete to us at the end of the day. It's a pretty standup guy who just wants to enjoy time with his old friends and new on his birthday and not even bring attention to the fact. Almanbet, Happy Birthday!
