Last week was RadioMost’s 4th Anniversary as the pioneer community radio station in Kyrgyzstan.  To mark the occasion we had a music festival at which a few of my fellow Peace Corps Volunteers performed a song.

This song, a translated cover of The Kink’s, “Have A Cup of Tea,” was such an anticipated success that these volunteers were requested to perform it on-air during an interview.  Here is the recording of that interview and the new hit single, “Peela Chai Each.”

Enjoy!
