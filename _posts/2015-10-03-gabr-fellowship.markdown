## The 2015 Gabr Fellowship


I am thrilled to announce that I have been awarded [the 2015 Gabr Fellowship](https://eastwestdialogue.org/)! The program is broken down into two parts: the first part will be a six week period of travel throughout Egypt and the United States with a group of twenty young professionals; the second part is a six month window in which to complete a development project in Egypt.

The participants come from a wide variety of professional sectors and are all emerging leaders in their field. There are ten fellows from Egypt, nine from America and one from England. While traveling, we will meet daily with economic, political, civic and arts leaders in order to gain a better understanding of Egyptian and American cultures. In Egypt, we will visit Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor. In the United States, we will visit New York, Washington DC and Atlanta.

As the fellows get to know one another, we will begin to form small groups and author action plans for development projects that can be implemented in Egypt. As part of the application process, each of us has already written an action plan. You can read [my action plan here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uIoBKQJTFPy7YuGQ31FZG23k9Tuze_E_Qo4qq578lv0/edit?usp=sharing), as an example of the type of work we will conduct.

It is a great honor to be selected as a Gabr Fellow and I will keep my blog and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/judsonlmoore) flowing with photos and updates.
