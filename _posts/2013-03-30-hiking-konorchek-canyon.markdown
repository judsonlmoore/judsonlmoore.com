I joined a group from the [Trekking Union of Kyrgyzstan](https://www.facebook.com/TUKKyrgyzstan/) today to explore Konorchek Canyon. The landscape in this canyon is very different from anything else I've seen in Kyrgyzstan. It reminds me of the canyons in New Mexico and Arizona. Much of Kyrgyzstan's landscape is made of sharp, hard black rock, but this place is red and soft. We hiked about 12 miles today, here are the photos.
