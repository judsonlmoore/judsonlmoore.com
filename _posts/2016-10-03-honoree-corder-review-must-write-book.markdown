## What To Expect From Honorée Corder's Latest


Spoiler Alert! YOU can write a book, and with Honorée Corder's most recent book, you will not only learn how to write a book, but you will also be inspired to put pen to paper. _You Must Write A Book_ is the fastest book I have ever read, finishing it in just two settings. I walked away smarter, inspired, and empowered. Give this book a read, and even if you've never considered the notion, you might just find yourself writing a book!





## In A Nutshell


**Highlights -** Covers every aspect of what it means to write a book: ideation, structuring, planning, publishing, promoting, and more. Details are as deep as they are wide, while still being an easy book to digest. Many additional online resources are provided to the reader.

**Lowlights -** Crafting the reader journey via a comprehensive story-arch is not covered in-depth. Outlining techniques are well explained but the creative component is lacking.

**Bottom Line -** You should read the rest of my post, but feel free to do it after you [buy the book](https://www.judsonlmoore.com/get/honoree-corder-you-must-write-a-book/). It is just that good! If you have ever considered writing a book on any topic but don't know where to start or even how to finish, then _You Must Write A Book_, by Honorée Corder is a must-read.






## Summary of You Must Write A Book


In Honorée Corder's 20th book, she has done something truly remarkable: **she is sharing her magic-sauce**. As a veteran author and business coach, she has a lot to offer to all of us. She is not your typical Harvard-to-Wall Street-to-Author kind of author. No, Honorée is a real person, with a real family, and a real life grounded in typical challenges and successes like what we all have.

How do I know? Because she is also my writing coach! And if you're reading this, then in a way, you're also reading a part of Honorée. Her methods, process, and encouragement have done great things for me, and after you've read _You Must Write A Book_, then great things will happen for you too!


## Topics Covered In-Depth


Honorée outlines her start-to-finish writing process, including:


Why writing a book is good for your business.
Why a book is better than a business card.
Who can write a book (hint: it's you!)
Crafting an Idea and outline.
Self Publishing.
Building a Launch plan.
Maximizing the value of your book.


I particularly enjoyed the depths she went into describing the very basic mathematics of writing a book. A book is impressive because it is long. It is easy for one to think that you can not write a book because you don't have so much to say. But how many emails have you written today? Facebook messages? Oh, you have things to say alright, and with a little planning, you can construct those thoughts into a beautiful and interesting book.

**Two key elements** that Honorée covers thoroughly is how to set a daily writing goal, and realizing that consistent efforts add up quickly. After you read this book, you will realize that by following some very basic steps, then before long, you too can own the esteemed title of 'author.'


<blockquote>_“Oh my goodness, that email had 764 words in it and I had writer’s block and it took me three weeks to write it!” said no one, ever_. - **Honorée_ Corder_**</blockquote>




## My Personal Takeaway


A central theme in my own writing and in this blog is the concept of ‘showing up.’ Most people never show up and give themselves the opportunity to succeed, and therefore they are stuck in a negative feedback loop of always wondering “what if” and “why not me?” However, what this book did for me was to remind me that my own life philosophies should be applied to the challenge of writing a book.

Honorée says many times that being a genius, having 40 years experience, or being a literary mastermind, is no prerequisite for writing a book. The fact is that MY story and MY voice are different from anyone else’s and will resonate with people in a way that no one else’s voice will. This is both a great reminder and great encouragement to write a book.
