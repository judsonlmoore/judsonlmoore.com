We all have dreams about our future. The places we might visit. The jobs we might have. People with whom we might fall in love. The successes we hope to accomplish. Many of these dreams are lofty, as they should be. 

Dreams are the most significant ambitions of our life. Because dreams are big, they come with a sense of challenge, even sacrifice, which we must make to accomplish them.

Many dreams come to us in the form of a *what if* question. As in, "*what if* I [insert dream here]." 

Many people only think about this in hindsight. They ponder, "I wonder what could have been if I had tried to _____." I find it tragic when people have identified their own *what if* but never sought an answer to that question.

My goal is to give you the inspiration and the tools to discover and pursue your own *what if*. When you do that, you can live a life void of regrets and never have to ask yourself, "I wonder what could have been if I had tried to _____."
