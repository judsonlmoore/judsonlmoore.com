"I had to suffer when I was your age, so you do too; it builds character!" Does this sound familiar to you? I adamantly disagree with this sentiment. "Character" can be learned in any number of ways, and struggles of the previous generation should not be the struggles of today's generation. 

Believing that the repetition of the previous generation's struggles is a rite of passage seems to be more like a way to stifle human progress and creativity than to advance it. When we can learn from others' mistakes without having to repeat them ourselves, then it allows us to develop and discover new problems that need solving.

There is much to be learned from those who came before us. Whether it is someone who stops to tell us the bridge ahead is flooded and we shouldn't drive there, or it is our grandparents relaying lessons learned after decades of experience, there is plenty we can and should learn from our predecessors. Repeating struggle is inefficient and should be avoided where possible.
