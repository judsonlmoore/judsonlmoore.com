I have been at my site now for 1 month. Though I have only scratched the surface of my work's potential and am still in the "honeymoon" phase, I feel like I have accomplished a lot. I will write more on the programs I have created later once they are funded. For now, allow me just to introduce you to my office.

The MediaMost Foundation is a non-governmental organization located in Talas City in the western part of the Kyrgyz Republic. The mission of MediaMost is to bring about social reform and development by bridging the information gap and thus helping people in Talas prosper by giving them access to information.

MediaMost's primary operation is RadioMost FM 100.5. This radio station is the pioneer community radio station of the Kyrgyz Republic. Broadcasting since July of 2007 with the assistance of UNESCO, the European Union Commission, GTZ, Deutsche Welle, and other partners, the current coverage
area in Talas Oblast reaches listeners in the districts of Karabuura, Talas, Bakay-Ata and the city of Talas. The audience of RadioMost is approximately 200,000 people.

At the moment, RadioMost is the only community radio station in Talas Oblast. The target audience are the citizens of Talas Oblast, specifically women, students, farmers, drivers, teachers, housewives, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.

RadioMost has its own FM radio transmitter power of 500kW and broadcasts 18 hours a day from it's studio in Talas City. Broadcasts are produced 60% in the Kyrgyz language, 35% in Russian and 5% in English. The format of the radio station is both information and music.

News stories cover a range of topics including: basic human needs, gender equality, human rights, democracy and good governance, and peace and security. The music selection comes from all over the world but is primarily traditional Kyrgyz music or Russian and Western pop music. My goal is to introduce funk and blues while I am here.

RadioMost's assets include its own production studio, complete with professional equipment, which is utilized to create radio programs, audio clips, jingles and other audio products. There is also a resource library and multiple offices equipped with computers and internet.

The team at RadioMost consists of professional journalists, technical engineers and volunteers who have considerable experience in radio, RadioMost personnel have been recognized for their work in various competitions at the national and international level. Many of the employees at RadioMost receive training and exchange experiences in foreign countries such as Germany, France, India, Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Nepal and the USA.

RadioMost has an extensive network of 53 community journalists from the various villages of Talas Oblast. These correspondents produce their own programs which broadcast every Tuesday and Thursday.
