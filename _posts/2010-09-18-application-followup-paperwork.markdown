Well they got the application but that (of course) just lead to more paperwork!  They sent me forms for fingerprints and are asking about financial (read: debt) standings.  Luckily I am pretty much debt free and getting the finger prints was easy enough thanks to the fine folks at the Pineville Police Department.




Follow up work done and submitted.




Still holding my breath.
