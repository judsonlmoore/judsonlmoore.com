My housemate, Jenny, works at the Alexandria Eye and Laser Center and got me hooked up with an eye exam.  That was easy enough.  Turns out, I still have perfect vision!

I got my medical packet in the mail a few days ago.  The eye part is clearly the easiest.  The rest of this looks like it is going to be pretty difficult to get done in time.

Here's lookin' at you!
